00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,930
[SINGING] In 1980 0 Tim
wrote Enquire at CERN,

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,600
invented the idea of
hyperlinks in turn.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,780
In 1990 Robert joined,
a document they charted,

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,131
that's pretty much how the
world wide web started.

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:15,630
They defined some
markup code called

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,010
HTML, which paved the
way for stylesheets

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,470
to decorate as well.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,610
Navigate through URLs
to internet locations,

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,430
you can learn it all with
Front-End Foundations,

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,320
you can learn it all with
Front-End Foundations.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,960
Eh.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,799
Welcome back.

13
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,340
In this section,
we're going to learn

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,440
how we can use CSS to change
the style of our HTML tags.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,260
So back in the early
days of the web

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,460
there was no CSS,
and that meant there

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,540
was no separation between the
HTML that defines your content,

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,070
and the way that HTML looks.

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,360
So you would have really
nasty HTML like this,

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,560
where you would determine
the color as an attribute

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,320
inside of your tag, and
you would write things,

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,160
like center, as tags
that really just modified

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,390
the way things looked, rather
than the way that they worked.

24
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,240
So thankfully the
people making the web

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,100
realize that that was not
the greatest way to go.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,330
So they created a
separate language

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,420
where you can make rules
for how tags should display,

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,920
and that language is called CSS.

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,440
With CSS you describe
how a tag should

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,620
look, saying things like,
make the h3 tag green,

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,010
make it have a
bigger font, and make

32
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,770
it have a border at the bottom.

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,270
The combination of
all of these CSS rules

34
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,470
is going to make your page
look the way that it does.

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,240
In fact, if go to any web
page and turn off the CSS,

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,450
they all kind of start
looking the same there's

37
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,430
no differences between them.

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,385
It's all of those CSS rules
that make all of the pages

39
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:52,680
that you visit look
different from each other.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,540
Here's what our page currently
looks like without CSS

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,130
in the browser.

42
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,810
Here's what it might look like
after we apply some CSS styles.

43
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,090
The way CSS works
is you write code

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,220
called selectors that
select HTML tags.

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,240
And then you can
alter the properties

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,630
of the display of
those HTML tags

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,860
to change the way
that things look.

48
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,650
So here we've got a simple
paragraph tag in HTML.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,360
If we want to select that
paragraph tag in CSS,

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,550
we start by writing the
letter P. The simplest way

51
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,350
to select a tag is just to
write the name of the tag

52
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,430
without those angle brackets.

53
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,260
So CSS does not include
the angle brackets.

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,460
In this example we're altering
the text decoration property,

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,250
which is one of many
properties that you can change

56
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,290
of the display of each tag.

57
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,210
Unlike before,
don't worry so much

58
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,050
about memorizing the properties.

59
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,960
You'll be able to
look them up later.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,040
We're setting the value of
the text decoration property

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,380
to underline, and the result
when we look in our browser,

62
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,550
is that our paragraph
tag is now underlined.

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,020
So the general format
for writing any selector

64
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,530
is to first write the selector
name, followed by a space

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,240
and then a curly bracket.

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Inside of that curly bracket
you can write a property name,

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,465
and then a colon, and then
the value for that property,

68
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,340
and then a semicolon.

69
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,960
This is actually very
important, if you

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,460
forget the curly bracket,
colon, or semicolon,

71
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,420
or don't have them
in the right spot,

72
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,970
then your CSS is not
going to work properly.

73
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,020
Finally you close off your list
of properties for that selector

74
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,915
by writing a closed
curly bracket.

75
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,360
That curly bracket
is nice, because it

76
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,950
lets you write more than one
property for each selector.

77
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,880
So back at our
paragraph tag we've

78
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,500
set the text
decoration to underline

79
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,370
in the previous slide.

80
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,220
But now we've also added a new
rule to set the color to red.

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,900
And if we look in
the browser now we

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,335
have a red underlined paragraph.

83
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,730
When we select the tag in CSS
by writing the tag name, that

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,300
rule we define is applied
to every single instance

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,040
of that tag in the HTML page.

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,530
So here, even though we've only
set one rule, where the font

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,410
size should be 24
pixels for li it

88
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,040
gets applied to every
single li tag on the page.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
You can see here that they
all just got a little bigger.

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,080
If you want to only apply a
CSS rule to a certain, smaller

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,670
subset of tags, one way we
can do that is with something

92
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,740
called a descendant selector.

93
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,240
The way a descendant
selector is written

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,080
is you first write the parent
tag in your selector name,

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,030
and then the child tag.

96
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,900
This CSS rule of making
the font size bigger

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,320
is now only going
to apply to li tags

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,850
that are children of ul tags.

99
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,420
And we view that
in the browser, we

100
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,370
can see that our honorerd
list text got bigger,

101
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,390
while our ordered
list text stayed

102
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,910
the same size, because the
rule doesn't apply to it.

103
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,160
Another type of selector
is the pseudo-selector.

104
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,630
You can see here that we've
set our anchor tags to all

105
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,340
have text-decoration:
none; which

106
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,140
means that every
link on our page

107
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,900
is no longer going to have
an underline under it.

108
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,100
If we also declare another
rule for the anchor tag,

109
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,270
with the colon hover
pseudo-selector,

110
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,410
and we set the text
decoration to underline

111
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,850
and the color to
dark red, that rule

112
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,400
is only going to be
applied when the mouse is

113
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,470
over the link, when
it's hovering over it.

114
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,420
So pseudo-selectors
are used to modify

115
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,310
the appearance of an HTML tag
based on some type of action

116
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,610
or behavior.

117
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,700
When you're no longer
hovered over the link,

118
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,190
then the underline and
the color red go away.

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,470
Another pseudo-selector
you could add

120
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,910
is called first child.

121
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,880
If a tag has children,
adding first-child to the end

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,620
of the selector name will
select the first child

123
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,300
that's nested inside of it.

124
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,800
Here you can see
we're only changing

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,990
the color of the first
ordered list item

126
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,515
by using the selector ol
colon first dash child.

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,740
I hope you're getting excited
about the crazy possibilities

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,870
of using CSS to change
the way your HTML looks.

129
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,750
So to write CSS inside
of our HTML pages

130
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,540
there's a couple
different ways to do it.

131
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,880
One of the simplest
ways to add CSS

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,860
is to include a style tag
as a child of the head tag.

133
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,900
Remember that we set
up our head tag before,

134
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,520
but we didn't have
anything in it.

135
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,019
And this is the first thing
that we're putting inside of it.

136
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,990
If we create that
style tag, and give it

137
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,920
an attribute name of type, with
the value of text slash CSS,

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,130
then the browser
is going to know

139
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,330
to look at that block of
CSS and apply it to our HTML

140
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,140
whenever the page is displayed.

141
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,890
So we can set up our CSS
rules, with our selectors,

142
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,660
and our properties,
and those values,

143
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,310
inside of that style
tag and they'll all

144
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,900
be applied to the HTML page.

145
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:19,540
Now you're ready
to start changing

146
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,710
the presentation of the tags
on your page in the challenges.
