1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,080
In this section,
we're going to look

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,286
at how to add background
images to tags on the page.

4
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:08,660
And this is the
layout that we're

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,701
going to be going for by
the end of this section.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,710
Background images are
not added in HTML.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,940
They're added in CSS.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,890
And there's several
different properties

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,630
that relate to adding
background images.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,410
The first is the
background-color property.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,970
Now, even if you're going
to be displaying an image,

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,800
you should always set a
background color in case,

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,970
for some reason, that
background image fails to load.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,540
You want to use that
color as a fallback.

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,560
So since our background image is
going to be a very dark image,

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,790
we'll set our background
color to dark gray.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,670
Next, we can use the
background-image property

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,130
to actually define
an image file.

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,140
And the syntax here is
a little bit different

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,960
than it was in HTML.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,430
You set this property
equal to the word url,

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,320
with lowercase letters,
open and close parentheses,

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,970
and then inside the parentheses
the relative path to your image

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,989
file.

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,880
Also notice that quotes don't
need to be around the path

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,090
when you're adding a
background image with CSS.

27
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,040
Here, that's going to
load the gobbler.png file

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,020
from our Images folder as
a background of the body,

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,280
since that's the
tag we're selecting.

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,490
Which looks like this.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,272
Next, we can control
the background position

32
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:32,000
of where in the container
the image appears.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,790
And we do that by
declaring two key words.

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,376
The first keyword can either
be top, center, or bottom.

35
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,750
And the second
keyword can either

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,340
be left, center, or right.

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,320
So here by saying
top left, we're

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,530
taking the small
background image,

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,970
and we're making it appear
in the top, left corner

40
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,420
of the body.

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,420
If we were instead to set the
background position to center

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,380
right, you can see here
that the small background

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,060
image will appear
vertically centered

44
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,850
in the body on the right side.

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,910
So since we just have the
small background image,

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,570
we would like it to repeat
across the entire page.

47
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,460
And we can do that with the
background-repeat property

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,760
by setting it to repeat.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,510
And you can see when we do
that the small background

50
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,740
image actually gets
tiled all across

51
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,940
and repeated all
across the body.

52
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,830
And it appears to be
one solid background.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Now there are some other
options for background repeat

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,470
like repeat just in
the x-direction or just

55
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,950
in the y-direction.

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,240
Or we can explicitly say don't
repeat this image at all.

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,676
But here it makes the
most sense to use repeat,

58
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,050
since we want this
to be repeated

59
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,190
in the x- and the y-directions
across the entire body tag.

60
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,290
Like some other CSS
properties, background

61
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,110
can be shortened
into just one line

62
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,270
by first defining the
color, then the image, then

63
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,960
the position, and then whether
it needs to repeat or not.

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,450
Since we have different
sections on our page,

65
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,900
we can also get creative with
our tile background images.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,580
And we can set one
background for the body,

67
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,830
another background
for the main content

68
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,110
which sits on top of the
body, and another background

69
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,240
for the recipes list items which
are on top of the main content.

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,660
And now when we view
that in the browser,

71
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,280
we can see that the main
content sits on top of the body.

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,640
And the recipes' lis sit
on top of the main content.

73
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,362
And it gives a little bit of a
sense of depth and separation

74
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,945
to the different
sections of our page.

75
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,970
Another common use
of background images

76
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,290
is to set up containers
that display backgrounds

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,250
and then add text
tags on top of them.

78
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,590
Here's a list from the Game Spot
website that does just that.

79
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,300
Each one of those games
has a background image

80
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,510
that has actual HTML
text tags on top of it.

81
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,130
It would not be practical to try
to do this with content images.

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,940
So layout images
in the background

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,850
are a good choice here.

84
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,390
So one way to do this is to
create a div specifically

85
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,760
for displaying a
background image.

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,150
So here on our
home.html we're going

87
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,860
to show a featured
recipe of the month.

88
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,660
To do that, we'll
create a new div

89
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,690
with a class of featured-image
inside of our main content.

90
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,160
And then we'll adjust the
CSS for that featured image

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,070
to have a width
and height that's

92
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,400
equal to the size of our
background image to make sure

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,890
that we're showing all of it.

94
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,640
And then we'll set the
background to load our image.

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,440
You can see here that our image
is displaying in this container

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,470
as we expect.

97
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,300
But since this is
a background image,

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,590
we can add a text tag
inside of that div

99
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,500
as a child of that div.

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,160
Here we're using an h3.

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,890
And we're saying
featured magic cake.

102
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,540
When we style that h3
tag, we can do things

103
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,930
like set the background
color to something different,

104
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,620
change the color of the text
inside, adjust the padding,

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,010
even do something crazy
like make the text all

106
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,450
uppercase so it really stands
out against that image.

107
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,970
When we look at
the browser again,

108
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,560
now we have text appearing
on top of an image

109
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,145
because that image
is in the background.

110
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,020
So now it's your turn
to play with background

111
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,250
images in the challenges.
