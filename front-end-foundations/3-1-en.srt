00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,685
[SINGING] In 1980 Tim
wrote ENQUIRE at CERN,

2
00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:06,660
invented the idea of
hyperlinks in turn.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,710
In 1990 Robert joined,
a document they charted.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,250
That's pretty much how the
world wide web started.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,420
They defined some
markup code called

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,410
HTML, which paved the way for
stylesheets to decorate, as

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,170
well.

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,060
Navigate through URLs
to internet locations.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,264
You can learn it all with
Front-End Foundations.

10
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:30,430
That's right.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,790
Welcome back to
Front-End Foundations.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,540
We've got our page in
a pretty good place.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,010
But there's still a
few layout issues.

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,650
One of those problems
that I can see right away

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,790
is that we've got a padding
applied to our navigation

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,730
and to our ingredients
unordered lists.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,170
But we really only want
that padding to be applied

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,800
to the ingredients list.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,970
The problem is
that we can't just

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,790
set padding on ul because that's
going to apply to all uls.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,100
We need a way to add padding
to one ul and not the other.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,560
So we need a way to
differentiate those two tags.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,040
Solving this problem
is a two-part fix.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,330
First, in the HTML,
we'll want to go

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,480
into the unordered list that
contains our site navigation

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,660
and give that tag an
attribute of class.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,720
And set that class
attribute equal to nav.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,870
Then in our CSS, we
can write dot nav.

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,870
And that tag will be selected.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,030
So we have a class
of nav in HTML.

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,590
And we can access the tag
that has that class by writing

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,510
dot class name.

33
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,710
Now inside of that
nav rule, we can

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,240
set our padding left to zero.

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,740
And our padding for our
site navigation is gone.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,270
But the padding for our
ingredients ul remains.

37
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,080
Now that we have the
special nav class,

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,200
what if you want to do
something like change

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,100
the style of only anchor
tags that are inside

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,440
of a tag with that class?

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,470
Well, we can do that with
descendant selectors,

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,250
just like we learned before.

43
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,560
So we can write dot nav space a.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,550
And that means find all
"a" tags that are inside

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,815
of the dot nav tag and apply
these styles to those anchors.

46
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,540
With this knowledge,
we should be

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,130
able to fix another main
problem with our unordered list

48
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,120
layouts-- the fact that our
site navigation is displaying

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,410
inline.

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,320
But our ingredients list
is also displaying inline.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,760
We would rather have
that still display block,

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,240
so we get those
nice bullet points.

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,610
Right now in our CSS
we've got this rule.

54
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,330
We're selecting all list
items that are children of ul

55
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,660
and setting them
to display inline.

56
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,120
That's making sure that the site
navigation and the ingredients

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,530
are displaying inline.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,450
But now that we have a more
specific navigation class,

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,820
we can move that
display inline rule

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,650
into the dot nav li selector.

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,540
And it's only going to apply
to the site navigation.

62
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,870
That means our
regular unordered list

63
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,890
inside of our
ingredients section

64
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,300
gets its bullet points back.

65
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,060
I want to point out
something important

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,740
when you start
working with class

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,230
selectors and regular
type selectors together.

68
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,660
The order that you write those
selectors in your CSS file

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,070
matters.

70
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,210
Here, I've got a dot
nav selector that

71
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,310
sets the padding left to zero.

72
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,660
That padding left for
the ul is actually

73
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,820
going to override the
padding for the dot nav.

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,470
That's because the HTML
tag that has a class of nav

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,520
is also a ul.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,660
Since the HTML tag
with a class of nav

77
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,680
is an unordered list,
by writing my generic ul

78
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,580
selector after that, I'm
actually overriding the padding

79
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,020
that I set in dot nav.

80
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,860
And that's not what
I want to happen.

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,030
So a good rule of thumb when
you're organizing your CSS

82
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,230
is to always declare
your broad, generic rules

83
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,110
for individual tags at
the top of your CSS file.

84
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,710
And then after that, you can
declare any specific rules

85
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,410
that will get applied to the
class versions of those tags.

86
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,190
Now we're setting a padding
left of 50 for all ul tags,

87
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,510
except for just this one ul
tag with a class of dot nav.

88
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,560
That's going to have a
padding left of zero.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,370
You might even say that the
broader rules cascade down

90
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,457
into the more specific rules.

91
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,040
And that's actually
part of the reason

92
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,570
why CSS is called
Cascading Style Sheets.

93
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,480
So far, we've only been
working in magic-cake.html.

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,130
But there's other
pages for our site.

95
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,130
One of those pages
is the recipes page.

96
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,330
So let's switch gears and
start building that page up.

97
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,270
The HTML structure of that page
will look something like this.

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,440
We've got the same h1
and site navigation.

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,490
But we've got
different header two,

100
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,970
indicating this is
the list of recipes.

101
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,090
And we'll set up an
unordered list of list items.

102
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,000
And instead of just a single
tag in those list items,

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,160
it will contain a link to a
recipe and a short description

104
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,280
of that recipe with
a paragraph tag.

105
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,730
If we try to view this page
right now in our browser,

106
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,890
though, it looks like
we're back to square one.

107
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,980
None of our styles that we
just created have carried over.

108
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,430
That's because in
magic-cake.html we included

109
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,030
the style tag in the
head of that page.

110
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,910
But that style tag is not in
the head of this recipes page.

111
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,470
So we need a way to take our
CSS, put it all in one file,

112
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,590
and link to that file from every
single one of our HTML pages

113
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,590
so that we don't have
to constantly rewrite

114
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,350
the same CSS over and over.

115
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,270
Luckily for us, CSS can actually
be written in a plain text

116
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,977
file, also.

117
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,560
All we have to do
is make sure that we

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,550
save that file with
the extension dot css.

119
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,190
So here we'll take all
the CSS that was currently

120
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,060
in that style tag in our
HTML, and we'll copy it over

121
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,330
to a file called main.css
so that all of our CSS

122
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,385
can live in one place.

123
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,150
Next, we need to import
main.css into our HTML file

124
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,520
so that those styles can
be applied to our page.

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,946
And the way we can do this
is with a tag called link.

126
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:28,320
Now, link looks a little bit
different than any tag we've

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,860
seen so far in that it doesn't
have a corresponding closing

128
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,520
version.

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,640
You just write the opening link
tag, and you don't close it.

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,840
So since there's
no closing part,

131
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,610
you might have
guessed that we can

132
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,280
tell this tag what to do by
giving it certain attributes.

133
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,980
The first attribute we
can add is called type.

134
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,112
And we can set it
equal to text/css.

135
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,570
And that's going to let the
browser know that we're getting

136
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,390
ready to load a CSS file.

137
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,380
Another attribute
called rel, which

138
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,580
is short for relationship,
can be set to stylesheet.

139
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,370
And that lets the HTML know
that it should relate to the CSS

140
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,600
and apply it to the page.

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
And finally, we can
use an href attribute,

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,330
just like we did when
we had an anchor tag,

143
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,940
to set the path of the CSS
file that should be loaded.

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,980
Adding the single link tag
to the head of your document

145
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,870
with these options is going to
make sure that CSS file gets

146
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,360
loaded at the top of your page.

147
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,250
Now if we reload our
recipes.html page

148
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,140
after we've linked
that CSS file,

149
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,930
things are looking much better.

150
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,650
We're now inheriting all
those same styles that we made

151
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,610
originally for magic-cake.html
But those broad rules are being

152
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,600
applied to all of the tags
inside of recipes.html, too.

153
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,550
The very top of
recipes.html looks OK as is.

154
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,610
But the list of recipes could
use a little bit of attention.

155
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,980
Because we're applying
those same broad styles

156
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,120
that we had in
magic-cake, you can

157
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,740
see that we've got these
bullet points next to each one

158
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,900
of the list items.

159
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,150
We've got an underline
underneath the name

160
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,300
of the recipe.

161
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,789
And the spacing, in general,
is just kind of off.

162
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,330
Instead, we can work
towards a layout

163
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,680
that's something like this.

164
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,500
We don't want any kind
of list style for the ul.

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,480
So we don't have any bullets.

166
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,860
We want to have a
border around the li,

167
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,160
so we can differentiate
the sections.

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,380
We want to have some left
padding between the list item

169
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,860
border and the content
area of the list item.

170
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,739
We want to remove that
border underneath the h3.

171
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,870
And we want to use our
green heading color

172
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,289
for that anchor tag
for the recipe name,

173
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,320
instead of just that
default blue link color.

174
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,900
So this is really
a similar problem

175
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,800
to the one we faced with
our site navigation.

176
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,270
We need a way to differentiate
the second unordered list

177
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,900
from any other
unordered list that

178
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,460
might appear on any other page.

179
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,280
So like before, we can assign
this unordered list a class.

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,720
And we'll call this one
recipes, since this style will

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,770
apply to only the recipes page.

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,130
Our existing broad ul style
has a left padding of 50.

183
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,650
We can take our recipes
class style, which is a ul,

184
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,830
and we can set the
list-style-type to none

185
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,870
to make those bullet
points disappear.

186
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,530
And we can set the
padding to zero

187
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,150
to turn that left padding off.

188
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,080
To add some border
and padding to the li,

189
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,235
we can just select the dot
recipes li and apply it there.

190
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,360
And this is what we'll get.

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,060
To create a more specific
version of our h3

192
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,820
that's inside of
the recipes ul, we

193
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
don't have to do a whole
lot because we actually

194
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,370
want to still inherit
all of these styles

195
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,341
from the generic h3.

196
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,510
We just want to turn
the bottom border off.

197
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,980
So we can do that by
writing border-bottom zero.

198
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,780
And finally, we'll
make a specific rule

199
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,310
that changes the color
of the anchor tags that

200
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,640
are only inside of the recipes
ul with the recipes class.

201
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,733
And we'll remove that
underline from them.

202
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,270
So now it's your turn to tweak
styles on multiple pages using

203
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,060
class selectors and
move all of your CSS

204
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,010
into a separate file
in the challenges.
