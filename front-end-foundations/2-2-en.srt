1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,610
The colors you've
been using so far

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,560
have descriptive names like
red, green, blue, yellow.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,680
But if you've ever looked
at any CSS colors before,

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,280
you probably have seen something
like this, this pound symbol

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,730
with a bunch of letters
and numbers after it.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,630
These are actually
hexadecimal numbers.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,570
And they're a very popular
way to set the color in CSS.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,870
Here's three
descriptive colors and

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,980
their hexadecimal equivalents.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,960
Red is FF0000.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,070
Black is just six zeroes.

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,950
And yellow is four F's
followed by two zeros.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,180
But what's really going on here?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,770
Why are these weird
letters equaling colors?

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,170
To start answering
that question,

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,590
let's look at the different
parts of a hexadecimal color.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,450
The first two numbers
actually determine

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,820
the amount of red in the color.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,360
The next two determine
the amount of green.

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,720
And the last two determine
the amount of blue.

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,950
So you're really looking
at three separate numbers,

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,430
all kind of just
chunked together

23
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,470
in one six-character statement.

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,200
If we were to attach a numeric
value to the possible colors

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,150
in HTML, they run from 0
to 255 decimal or 00 to FF

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,930
hexadecimal.

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,460
So when we look at a
number like FFFF00,

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,080
we're really saying
that this color

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,460
is the maximum amount of red,
the maximum amount of green,

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,807
and absolutely no blue at all.

31
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,890
And that's roughly equivalent
to the color yellow.

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,830
So to quickly understand
why this works

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,880
and why we can use letters
in the place of numbers,

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,170
let's first look at how
to make a decimal number.

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,800
Now, decimal numbers can
contain the value zero

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,070
through 9 and nothing
else, no letters.

37
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,210
If we have the
decimal number 76,

38
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,950
it's really like saying 7
times 10 plus 6 times 1.

39
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,930
We multiply the first number
by 10, the second number by 1.

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,790
We add those together,
and we get 76.

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,630
Now, if this were a hexadecimal
76 instead of a decimal,

42
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,930
instead of multiplying
by 10, we multiply by 16.

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,770
That hexa part of
hexadecimal means six.

44
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,650
So 6 and 10 is 16, right?

45
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,240
So if we multiply the 7 by 16
and then add it to 6 times 1,

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,210
we get 118.

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,920
So believe it or not, 76
in hexadecimal numbers

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,730
is actually equivalent to 118
in our normal decimal number

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,230
system.

50
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,730
So stay with me.

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,840
Now we've got hexadecimal FF.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,010
So we can calculate the
decimal version of this

53
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,950
by taking F times
16 plus F times 1.

54
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,150
But how do we
multiply by a letter?

55
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,040
That doesn't really
make any sense, right?

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,160
Well, these letters
actually stand for numbers.

57
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,460
A stands for 10.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,460
B stands for 11, and so on.

59
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,010
And F stands for 15.

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,180
So when we have the
hexadecimal number FF,

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,260
we're actually calculating
it by having 15 times

62
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,921
16 plus 15 times 1.

63
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,310
That equals 255 decimal.

64
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,130
So with that in mind, let's
look at a more complicated

65
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,920
hexadecimal color, 7403AB.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,860
We know that the first
two represent red.

67
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,170
The next two represent green.

68
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,570
And the last two represent blue.

69
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,830
So if we first look
at the red color,

70
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,640
we can see that it's 7 times 16
plus 4 times 1, which gives you

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,070
116.

72
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,940
And you can see how to calculate
green and blue, as well.

73
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,920
So this really, then,
means that this color

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,620
is some amount of red, almost no
green at all, and way more blue

75
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,450
than red.

76
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,490
And that ends up looking
like the color purple.

77
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,260
Here's another
hexadecimal color, FF00B3.

78
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,950
If we do the math and get the
decimal equivalents of these,

79
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,320
we see that this color
has a ton of red.

80
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,820
It actually has the maximum
amount of red possible.

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,870
It has no green
at all, no green.

82
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,780
And it has a little
less blue than red.

83
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,280
And that color actually
displays as hot pink.

84
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,520
So by using hexadecimal
colors, we actually

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,460
get 256 times 256 times
256 possible color values.

86
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,140
That's 16 million colors.

87
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,110
That's a lot of colors.

88
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,630
So it's time for you play
with some of those 16 million

89
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,360
in the challenges.
