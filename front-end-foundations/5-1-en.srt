00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:04,446
[SINGING] In 1980 Tim
wrote ENQUIRE at CERN,

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:07,410
invented the idea of
hyperlinks in turn.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,345
In 1990 Robert joined,
a document they charted.

4
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,844
And that's pretty much how the
whole world wide web started.

5
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:14,573
They defined some
markup code called

6
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,284
HTML, which paved the way for
stylesheets to decorate, as

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:17,784
well.

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,748
Navigate through URLs
to internet locations.

9
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,712
You can learn it all with
Front-end Foundations.

10
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:27,710
You can learn it all with
Front-End Foundations.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,810
Welcome back to
Front-End Foundations.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,990
In this final level
of the course,

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,780
we're going to be polishing
up our site's fonts

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,700
and even look at how we can
implement some basic form

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,260
designs for our Suggest page.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,480
So fonts and font styles
can be controlled with CSS.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,380
On a page like Code
School, you can

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,170
see that we've got a
couple different font

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,990
styles in action.

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,390
We've got a bold, large font
for the tagline, Learn By Doing.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,560
We've got a regular,
medium-weight font

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,830
for the secondary
tagline, No setup.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,480
No hassle.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,060
Just learning.

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,910
We've got regular, normal
font for this sentence

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,170
or two of description
of Code School.

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,450
We've got a smaller
font for this tiny link

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,360
that says "Learn where to start"
that takes you to a new page.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,370
We've got an
uppercase font applied

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,410
to the call-to-action
button "view our courses."

31
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,420
And then we've got an
uppercase font, again,

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,980
with bold applied to this
"learn, get, backbone,

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,810
sass, rails, and jQuery" list.

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,435
So we've got multiple font
styles on a single page.

35
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,090
Back on our Magic
Cake page, we can

36
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,330
see that there's definitely
been some fonts and font

37
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,640
styles applied.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,440
And we haven't applied
them ourselves,

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,990
so there's probably some
default font trickery

40
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,344
that's happening in here.

41
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:46,760
But first let's
look at how we can

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,830
change the font of our page.

43
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,540
In the body
selector, which means

44
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,070
it's going to apply to every
tag that's inside the body,

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,850
I can use the
font-family property

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,210
to specify a list of
fonts that should be used.

47
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,516
Now, the first font in that
list is the ideal font,

48
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:03,890
meaning that the
browser is going

49
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,449
to try first to load that font.

50
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,290
If the browser can't
find that first font,

51
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,200
you can specify a
list of other fonts

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,485
that it should try to
load in the order it

53
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,010
should try to load them.

54
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,180
So here I'm also
trying to load Arial

55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,540
if Helvetica is not available,
Times New Roman if Arial is not

56
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,600
available, and then
finally just a very

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,150
generic sans-serif default
font if none of those fonts

58
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,460
are available.

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,700
Remember, not all browsers
and operating systems

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,680
have all fonts
installed by default.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,970
So sometimes the font you
want is not just always going

62
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,410
to be available in the browser.

63
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,290
So here's our Magic Cake
page after changing the font

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,860
to Helvetica.

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,890
And you can see that all of
the fonts for every type of tag

66
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,550
have been updated because
we applied this to the body.

67
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,650
If we look a little closer,
though, some of our tags

68
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,280
definitely have different sizes
and weights to those fonts.

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,890
We didn't set those
in our CSS yet.

70
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,870
So this is a clue that lets us
know that the browser is again

71
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,160
applying some of its default
behaviors to our CSS.

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,510
We didn't set this.

73
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,570
The browser set it.

74
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,510
So just like we did with
padding, borders, and margins,

75
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,750
we can reset our fonts to
a baseline default level.

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,490
One of the easiest
ways to do this

77
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,480
is to set the font-size property
to 100% for all the tags

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,780
that appear in your page and set
the font property to inherit.

79
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,120
And you can see, when you
do that, now every tag's

80
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,150
font on the page is the same
size and the same weight,

81
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,820
which is now a great template
for us to improve upon.

82
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
So we can start with our h2.

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,220
And we can use the
font-size property

84
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,870
to change the size
to 26 pixels, which

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,560
is going to make it a lot bigger
than the paragraph text that's

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,430
on the page.

87
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,990
Now pixels aren't
the only option

88
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,220
when you're choosing size.

89
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,950
You can also use relative
sizes like percentages and ems.

90
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,650
But like I mentioned in an
earlier level, in this course

91
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,990
we're focusing just
on fixed widths

92
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,810
so that you don't have too many
options while you're learning.

93
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,020
We can change the
thickness of this header

94
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,070
by adjusting the
font-weight property

95
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,230
and setting it to bold.

96
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,279
Normal is the default weight.

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,540
And bold makes the
font look bold.

98
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,680
You can also use
some other keywords

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,300
like lighter and bolder.

100
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,190
Or you can just use
numbers, like 100, 200, 300,

101
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,090
all the way through 900, to
set the weight of the font.

102
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,540
There's many other
font properties

103
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,120
that you can look up in
a CSS reference guide

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,692
when you're writing
your own font styles.

105
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,150
And we've just
listed a few of them

106
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,200
here so you can see the
effect they have on some text.

107
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,660
Aside from the font
properties, there's

108
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,420
another important text-based
property called line-height.

109
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,400
Line-height is like margin
for each line inside a box.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,230
You remember that we can adjust
the space between content boxes

111
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,080
by using the margin property.

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,330
But that's not going
to adjust the spacing

113
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,990
of the lines in a single box.

114
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,490
And that's what
line-height is for.

115
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,730
By setting the line-height
to some number,

116
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,530
we can make the spacing
smaller or bigger

117
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,990
in between lines
of the same tag,

118
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,480
in this case, the
same paragraph tag.

119
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,180
So now it's your turn to
adjust your site's font styles

120
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,010
and line heights
in the challenges.
