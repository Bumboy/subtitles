00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome back to Level 3,
Section 2, where we'll

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,650
be introducing the Django Admin.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,960
One of the most
powerful parts of Django

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,250
is the automatic
admin interface,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,500
located at localhost/admin.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,810
It reads metadata
from your models

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,130
to provide a quick interface
for viewing and editing them.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,230
This is where trusted users,
that are marked as staff,

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,480
can log in and manage
content on your site.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,860
For instance, you can view
the objects in your model,

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,790
edit them, and create new ones.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,520
To use the admin site, we
need to create a super user.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,330
To do that we run the
command, python manage.py

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,410
createsuperuser.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,586
Then enter your user
name, email, and password.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,840
Now in our browser, we can go
to localhost/admin and login.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,020
When we login, we can see
our automatically generated

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,160
groups and users, but
not our treasure model.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,580
We actually have to register our
models with the admin for them

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,250
to show up.

21
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,050
In order to see our
models in the admin,

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,630
will need to register
them in admin.py.

23
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,790
We do this by importing
our treasure model

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,990
and then registering
Treasure with the command,

25
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,330
admin.site.register.
Now when we login,

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,810
we can see our treasure model.

27
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,120
We can see all of the
objects inside of our model

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,980
and we can add more
treasures, using the form,

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,265
like an arrowhead,
and a horseshoe.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,330
If we demo our
app again, we have

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,840
the new items we just added,
the arrowhead and horseshoe.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,340
Congratulations on
finishing Try Django.

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,690
First, you have a few challenges
to complete on using the admin,

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,855
and then I'll see you
in the outro video.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,080
For fool's gold.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,950
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,371
We need to--
