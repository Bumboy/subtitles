00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome back to
Level 1 Section 2

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,250
where we'll be covering URL
dispatcher best practices.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,430
Right now, localhost/index
goes to our homepage,

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,030
but this is kind of an ugly URL.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,860
If you were going
to go to google.com,

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,960
you wouldn't type
google.com/index,

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,295
so we'd like to get
rid of that /index.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,750
First, we'll remove index/ from
our regular expression and then

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,310
send an empty path
to load our view.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,210
Our pattern is now an empty
string with just a carat.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:49,260
And if we load local host, we
see that our view loads without

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,045
typing /index.

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,610
In Django, it's a best
practice to have a project URL

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,390
dispatcher and an
app URL dispatcher.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,510
Right now, our
project's URL dispatcher

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,390
is handling all of
the requests, but we'd

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,000
like to funnel requests
for our main app

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,850
to our main app's
URL dispatcher.

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,710
So the first thing we'll do is
create that new urls.py file

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,540
in the main app folder.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,090
So now in the
projects urls.py file,

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,740
instead of mapping to
main apps view.index

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,690
we'll instead include
all of main apps URLs.

24
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,580
Notice to use that include
function, we need to import

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,720
include from django.conf.urls.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,285
So now we'll create our
urls.py file in our main app.

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,080
We'll still need to
import URL, and we'll also

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,920
want to import our views.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,700
If you want to import a specific
module from your current app,

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,832
you can leave off the
package and just type dot.

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,210
So now we want to create our
app specific URL patterns.

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,720
We'll start with
an empty string,

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,110
but we'll also terminate
it with a dollar sign

34
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,280
so that this doesn't
match all strings.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,095
And then the second parameter
will be our views.index.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,610
Now if we load local host with
no path, we see our homepage.

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,600
So things are working the
same as they did before,

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,270
even though we've refactored
things behind the scenes.

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,130
And this will allow us
to stay more organized

40
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,392
as our app grows.

41
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,420
That's it for Level 1.

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,890
Now it's time for you to
refactor your URL dispatcher

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,240
in the challenges.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,960
Have fun.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,584
Let's get--

[BEEP]

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,390
Django from a-- OK.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:01,890
[BEEP]

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,211
Creating in this course--

[BEEP]

51
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,890
That would have sceptre--
