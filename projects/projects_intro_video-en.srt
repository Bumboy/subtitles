00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,310
Welcome to Projects,
where you truly

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,760
get to put into practice what
you've learned at Code School

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,420
by writing code on your
local computer. Then having

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,810
Code School check your work.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,000
To get started, we'll show
you how to fork and clone

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,110
a repository on GitHub.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,960
And if you've never used Git
or GitHub before — don't worry.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,080
We'll walk you through what you
need to know to get started.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,940
Once you have the
code on your computer,

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,370
we'll have some tasks
for you to complete

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,360
in your editor of choice.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,950
Then, when you've successfully
completed the tasks

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,110
and pushed your
changes to GitHub,

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,090
we'll check your code for you.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,930
After completing a
project, you'll not only

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,540
know how to work
with that technology.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,490
You also have a
working local project

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,340
to continue learning
with and expand upon.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,320
And as an added bonus, you can
even earn badges on Code School

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,880
by completing projects.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,630
Head over to the "Hello,
Code School" Project

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,440
to give Projects a try.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,530
Or pick out a project
on a technology you want

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,420
to learn, and jump right in.
