1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,869
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,160
In this section, we're going
to go over partials, which

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,679
allows us to break our views
up into different parts

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,345
for reusability.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,100
For end result, we
want our index pages

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,570
to have a little
section that outlines

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,170
what our characters details.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,790
We want to also use
exact same outline

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,390
of details on our details page.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,140
Now rather than implement
this section multiple times

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,760
in different places, we can
create what's called a partial

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,205
and share that
between the pages.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,960
We'll create our
character sheet partial

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,450
inside our shared folder,
just like we would our layout.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,090
It also has the same
naming convention

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,594
where it'll be underscore
character sheet, with character

17
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:45,510
and sheet capitalized.

18
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,550
Our character sheet
partial is just

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,330
going to basically be
all the information

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,330
we need to present the view.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,746
We're not actually going to
go through it all because this

22
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,380
is stuff we've already learned.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,330
What we're going to
do in this case, is

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,190
we're going to actually
add our model declaration

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,899
at the top for our
character object,

26
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,440
and then immediately
after that we're

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,910
going to do at html dot
partial parentheses and then

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,070
inside quotation marks the name
of our underscore character

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,750
sheet partial followed by model.

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,180
What this is going to
do, is when I actually

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,640
go to render this
page, it's going

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,290
to grab that character
sheet partial

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,260
and place it in place
of this at html partial,

34
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,102
and it's going to use that
model data in our partial.

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,630
Now, if we actually look at
our character details page,

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,410
if we were to compare this
from having that code directly

37
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,220
in the details page
versus the partial,

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,970
the should be indistinguishable
to the end user, which

39
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,240
is exactly how it should be.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,670
From here let's go
to our index page

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,940
and set it up to use a partial.

42
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,540
Before, we were just
having a label placed,

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,795
with the actual character name.

44
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:05,470
For each item in the
list this at html partial

45
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,434
is going to be replaced by
the contents of that partial,

46
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,475
giving us the details for
each of our characters.

47
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,850
At this point, we're
going to set up

48
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,390
or index action to return only
the characters that are active.

49
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,080
Just like before, we can use
a lambda expression-- return

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,350
only those records-- and then
pass those through to our view.

51
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,200
At this point, both are
index and our details pages

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,710
are set up to use our partials.

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,650
If we look at both our
index and our details page,

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,460
the details about the
individual character

55
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,750
will be the same
between both pages.

56
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,620
Some conventions to
note-- you'll notice,

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,320
the naming conventions
for our partial

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,920
is the same as our layout where
it's underscore PascalCase.

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,390
Now, in our instance, we
actually put a partial

60
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,730
in the shared folder.

61
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,130
This is one of two very
common conventions for where

62
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,640
you put your partials.

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Typically, you either
put all of your partials

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,992
in the shared folder,
or you put the partials

65
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,950
in whatever folder is
appropriate for the model

66
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,540
they're dealing with.

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,270
In that case, if I had
a character partial,

68
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,460
I would put that under
the characters folder.

69
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,730
Meanwhile if I had a partial
that either used a unique model

70
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,040
to itself, or it used some
combination of models,

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,920
then I would put that
in the shared folder.

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,670
Now it's your turn to set up
partials in the challenges.

73
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,510
Have fun.
