00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,190
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,920
In this section, we're going to
go over front-end validation.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,450
Front-end validation is
important for giving the user

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,700
the best experience possible.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,990
You do want to make sure to
have both front-end and back-end

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,270
validation, though,
because you can't always

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,350
depend on front-end validation.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,370
The important thing is front-end validation

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,622
keeps everything
on the client side,

10
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:26,080
so when they hit
the Submit button,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,594
they instantly get a response.

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,010
They don't have to wait for a
server to interact with them

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,600
and respond.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,550
To set up front-end
validation, we're

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,790
going to need a reference
two JavaScript libraries.

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,060
These are going to be
jquery.validate and

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,062
jquery-validation-unobtrusive.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,952
These are actually already
in the MVC template.

19
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,910
We just need to add these
references to tell it

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,135
we want it on these pages.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,640
The next step is to
go to a view that we

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,820
want to add front-end
validation to to create

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,920
a div with the
asp-validation-summary tag

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,490
helper with a value of all.

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,490
What this is going to do is
any time we have a validation

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,770
error, this div is going to
have an unordered list of all

27
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,550
of those errors presented in it.

28
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,590
As you can see here,
our front-end validation

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,830
is all set up.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,840
If we were to enter our
information incorrectly,

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,140
such as make our name too
short or to give values

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,050
outside of the range
we're allowing,

33
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,720
we're going to get the summary of errors underneath our Submit

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,359
button.

35
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,900
And that's all there is needed
to set up front-end validation

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,725
in ASP.NET.

37
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,350
Now you're going to
go ahead and you're

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,220
going to actually set up a page
to use front-end validation

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,980
in the challenges ahead.

40
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,530
Enjoy.
