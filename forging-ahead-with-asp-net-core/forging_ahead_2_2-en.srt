1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,850
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,641
In this section, we're
going to go over how

3
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:08,740
to present data in our views.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
In the last level, we
set up our CRUD methods

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,962
to read from and
write to our database,

6
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:16,130
but we don't have any views
to be able to access those.

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,880
So what we're going
to go ahead and do now

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,962
is-- we're going to create our
index view and our create view

9
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:23,420
to be able to access
those actions.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,809
Let's start with our
index dot cshtml page.

11
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,350
We've gone ahead and we've added
a bunch of the starting code

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,420
here for you.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,950
We're going to go
ahead and create

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,330
a link to our Create action
directly below our heading.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,670
We're going to do this
by creating HTML link.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,260
Now we're going to add two
attributes to this-- asp dash

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,620
action and asp dash controller.

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,050
Our asp dash action we're
going to set to Create

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,830
and our asp dash
controller, we're

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,430
going to set to Characters.

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,280
The template will render the
URL based on the two attributes

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,510
we have provided.

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,070
If you were to look at the
rendered code in the browser,

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,400
you would actually see the href
equals character slash create.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,040
From here, we're going to create
a link to our Details action.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,920
Just like before, we're
going to use the asp dash

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,700
action only to
Details this time,

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,000
and the asp dash controller
to the Characters' controller.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,780
The catch is--
our Details action

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,160
is expecting an input parameter
of the name of our Character.

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,960
We can do this by adding the asp
dash route dash name attribute

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,947
with the items' name property.

33
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:39,530
What this is going
to do is it's going

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,400
to add a query string for
the name that will map up

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,810
with our input parameter
of our Details action,

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,720
as you can see below.

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,069
From here, we're going to
create our Create page.

38
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,610
Now we've set up a
bunch of this code

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,784
already for you, as most of
this we've already seen before.

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,450
This may look complex,
but a lot of this

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,090
is just the CSS we're using
to make this page look nice.

42
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,820
One of the things
you will notice

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,136
that is ASP.NET
specific, is the asp dash

44
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:13,750
for tag helper,
which we're going

45
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,700
to set to Name as it's going
to tie to our Name property.

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,420
What this is going to do is
when we use it with Label,

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,620
it's actually going to set
that Labels' value to be

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,890
the Name of the property.

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,770
We'll also use asp
dash for on the input.

50
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,270
And what this is
going to do is it's

51
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,519
going to go a step farther
than it did with the Label.

52
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,760
It's actually going to
change the type of the input

53
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,000
to be whatever is appropriate
for the type of the property,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,030
as well as set the ID and
the name of that input

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,590
to match the Name
of that property.

56
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,580
You can see the
resulting HTML here.

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Well, that works great
for any of our properties

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,110
that names happen
to be only one word.

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,850
But an example of our
is active property,

60
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,880
we'd probably want to display
that as two separate words.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,930
We can't do that with asp
dash for without going

62
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,820
a step farther and
adding data annotations.

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,040
So let's go back to
our character model,

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,820
and add in using statement for
system dot component model dot

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,590
data annotations.

66
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,090
The next step we would
take is on the line

67
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,890
directly above our
is active property,

68
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,900
we're going to add the
display attribute with name

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,720
equals to is active
with a space in it.

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,000
This will tell asp
dash for any time

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,470
it is to display the name
of the is active property,

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,765
to go ahead and add that space.

73
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,750
If you look at the rendered
output of our template

74
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,840
at this point, and you look
at the ID and Name attributes,

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,830
you'll notice that
they're all still

76
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,380
set to the is active
without the space, which

77
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,190
is necessary for them to
map up with the property.

78
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,240
However, in the label
where we're actually

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,120
returning the value to be
displayed to the screen,

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,125
it now has our space.

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,890
At this point
we've got our views

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,860
to read from and
write to our database.

83
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Now it's your turn to
set up your own views

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,290
in the challenges.

85
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,620
Have fun.

86
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,480
All the code you're seeing
here is just a bunch of ahhh.

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,880
Partial with that
character's details--

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,430
I mispronounced it
all sorts of wrong.

89
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,360
I said feels.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,885
That's not even a word.

91
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:26,290
Well, I guess it is a word.
