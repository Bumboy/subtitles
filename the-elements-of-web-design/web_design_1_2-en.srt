1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,140
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,530
Now let's get started on Section
Two: Designing and Testing.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,180
Now that we have
our two personas,

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,350
how do we use them
to create wireframes?

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,310
The answer is a user-centered
design approach.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,330
User-centered
design is a process

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,480
in which the needs, wants,
and limitations of the user

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,810
are given extensive attention
at each stage of the design

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,980
process.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,960
Having the personas in
place is the foundation

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,350
of a user-centered
design approach.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,960
There are five
primary steps that we

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,530
need to take to build
and test a feature.

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,950
We need to identify
the primary feature.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,200
We need to understand why a
persona needs that feature.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,760
Then we need to research,
sketch, and test our design.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,330
We will start by identifying
the first feature to build.

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,770
So let's take a look at Walter
to see what we can find out.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,620
It appears that Walter
has limited time

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,820
to spend on a product, based
on the information provided.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,840
We know he wants to stay up
to date on the latest trends

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
and breakthroughs, and
he would like the ability

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,120
to read stories on his iPad.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,790
Now in June's
persona, we can see

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,270
that she wants to read
stories on polymer

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,080
and read articles on her phone.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,530
If we look back at the
design brief from Amanda,

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,340
we can see that she wants
users to easily find and read

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,150
articles.

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,120
When we look at our
personas, we can

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
see that they want
the same thing this

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,830
is the primary feature
of the product,

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,340
and this is where we will start.

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,520
Now we can move to
step two: understanding

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,340
why personas need this feature.

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,652
So why do our personas
need this feature?

37
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:42,110
Well, if we look
back at Walter, we

38
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,026
can see that he wants
to quickly find and read

39
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:46,610
the latest stories,
primarily on his iPad.

40
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,970
And June wants to read stories
specific to her discipline

41
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,390
and typically on her phone.

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,960
With this information,
we know they

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,970
need to find and read articles,
and mobile's important as well.

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,790
Now that we have
the why, let's look

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,890
into how other people have
solved it for their users.

46
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,490
Tumblr is a well-established
blogging platform

47
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,330
with a large user base.

48
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,050
If we look at their
site, we can see

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,450
that they have a
large search bar

50
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,810
at the top of the screen and
category links in the top left.

51
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,860
Another cool feature
is the ability

52
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,150
to look at your search terms
and find similar searches

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,560
that you can explore.

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
This can help keep
users engaged,

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
and they're more
likely to find content

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,910
that they're looking for.

57
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,770
Below the user section
are filters to help

58
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,540
refine your search.

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,870
And search results are displayed
on cards in a four column

60
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,550
layout.

61
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,090
This can help maintain
a recognizable pattern

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,800
on desktop and mobile.

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Medium is another
well-established blogging

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,410
platform.

65
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,400
They rely on search and group it
with user-focused interactions,

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,410
like writing a story,
notifications, and a link

67
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,640
to your profile.

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,650
Below that, they
encourage you to connect

69
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,920
with a social account, so
they can prioritize posts

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,106
from people you know.

71
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,580
A feature like this can
help cultivate a more

72
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,610
personalized
experience for users.

73
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,500
Below that, they
display top stories.

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,615
And they use a two column
layout to display their content.

75
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,910
Now that we've done
a little research,

76
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,780
we can start sketching
out our ideas

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,350
and testing with our users.

78
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,930
Here's what a rough sketch of
our website might look like.

79
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,160
Sketching is a great way to get
out ideas with low commitment.

80
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,640
And sketching can be
done as a group exercise.

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
It's important to
design for mobile

82
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,470
when working on features.

83
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,790
You can see ours here.

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,540
Designing for mobile will
keep your design focused

85
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,510
on the user's needs and prevent
bloat in the design process.

86
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,020
Wireframes are another
great solution.

87
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,650
They allow us to test
and refine navigation,

88
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,900
see how content lays
out on the page,

89
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,340
study and rapidly refine the
interface in the interactive

90
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,160
elements, and evaluate
the overall effectiveness

91
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,160
of the page layout
and usability.

92
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,690
A few of the more popular
tools used for wireframing

93
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,410
are OmniGraffle,
Sketch and Balsamiq.

94
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,620
These tools can help you
quickly get out ideas

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,040
and get them in front of users.

96
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
I also want to note
that when testing,

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,010
it's important that
you use real content.

98
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,850
Users have to know
what they're looking at

99
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,399
and how to interact with it.

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,425
You should never use lorem
ipsum or any kind of filler text

101
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,800
when you're testing
your designs.

102
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,080
Alright,

103
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,730
now that we have some wireframes
to test against, let's

104
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,140
get them in front of users and
start getting some feedback.

105
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,300
We created two designs to test.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,560
First, we need to print
out each wireframe.

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,700
In our first design,
we went with a large search

108
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,270
across the top and
a two column layout

109
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,990
with sorting and categories
in the aside div.

110
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,600
In the second design, we
put search and sorting

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,130
in the top aligned
navigation with categories

112
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,690
below that in a
secondary navigation.

113
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,180
We also went with a three
column tiled layout.

114
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,140
Now that our wireframes
have been printed,

115
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,840
we are going to conduct
what UsabilityHub coined

116
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,020
the five second usability test.

117
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,090
We will put them in
front of our testers

118
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,540
and ask them these
three simple questions.

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,350
What does this feature do?

120
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,830
What do you like about it?

121
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,630
What don't you like about it?

122
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,670
Five second tests
help us understand

123
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,170
peoples' first impressions
of our designs.

124
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,840
The five second test will help
you discover if your design is

125
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
understandable and easy to use.

126
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,050
A few things to keep in
mind when testing are,

127
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,110
you're testing the
feature not the user.

128
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,550
Always remain neutral.

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,780
Listen and watch.

130
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,370
Never jump in and assist or
lead the user in any way.

131
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,590
Take good notes.

132
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,540
Capture what they do
and what they say.

133
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,280
And try to test between five
and seven users at a time.

134
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,880
OK.

135
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
So I've conducted
some user testing,

136
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,090
and here are my results.

137
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,030
I can see that neither
was a home run,

138
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,131
but we could take the
pros from both designs

139
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,131
and create a new design.

140
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,330
You should test through
the entire design process,

141
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,290
from sketching to live code.

142
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,086
Testing the entire
process ensures

143
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:08,710
that you are on the
right path, and you

144
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,840
are building a product
your users actually want.

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,120
Understanding who your
target audience is

146
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,980
and testing your designs
are the core principles

147
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,648
of a user-centered
design approach.

148
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Now let's jump into
some challenges,

149
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,650
and I'll see you
in the next level.
