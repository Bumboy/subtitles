00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,500
[SINGING] No one's
buying all your widgets,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,965
and you're losing people quick.

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,970
They're lost inside
your website, and they

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,740
don't know where to click.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,280
If you had learned
about your users,

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,410
you'd know where you went wrong.

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,500
They'd be engaging
with your content,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,220
and I wouldn't sing this song.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,230
User centered design,
helps improve communication,

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,070
Navigation, pagination,
Architect your information.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,320
Add a motto or a
tagline, with search

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,725
so they can find a
better website is

00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:38,360
defined with The
Elements of Web Design.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
Welcome to The
Elements of Web Design.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm Paul Hershey.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,350
As the internet
has evolved, users

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,960
have become less tolerant of
bad design and bad experiences.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,710
And this is why we need to plan
our experiences for end users.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,840
That's where the elements of
web design come into play.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,660
In this course, we'll cover
persona creation, user testing,

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,170
site organization, wire framing
and sketching, navigation best

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,090
practices, form design,
home page best practices,

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,220
pricing page design, and
mobile design best practices.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,320
If you haven't taken Code
School's Fundamentals of Design

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,400
course, I'd highly recommend it.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,490
It's not necessarily a
prerequisite to our course,

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,000
but it will give you the
fundamentals of typography,

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,450
color, and layout.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,260
Taking both courses
together will give you

30
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,960
a better overall understanding
of the design process

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,890
when you build your
products and websites.

32
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,430
This is neither a
UI or a UX course,

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,810
though I do want to make a
distinction between both.

34
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,080
UX, meaning user
experience, is the process

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,550
of understanding the end user.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,890
It's creating personas, creating
experience maps, and testing.

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,650
On the other hand, UI,
or user interface design,

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,860
consists of interaction
design, usability design,

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,220
visual hierarchy,
and icon design.

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,380
As well as color
and type choices.

41
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,080
There's a lot that
goes into this

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,840
to ensure that a
product or service is

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,870
easy to use and understand.

44
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,880
This course will be
a very broad overview

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,500
of both of these disciplines.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,240
It would be impossible to
teach them both in one course.

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
My goal is to give you
a common sense approach

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,060
to design when you're creating
your websites and products.

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,720
With that said, let's
get started on level 1

50
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,760
with personas.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,250
Our client Amanda has brought
us a new project that she

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,920
would like us to design.

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,270
It's called ChemCraft.

54
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,540
It's a social blogging platform
for the chemistry industry.

55
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,900
We will spend this course
building out her design.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,850
She wants to make sure that
users can easily find and read

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,150
articles, can publish
their own articles,

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,650
have a dashboard where
they can see analytics,

59
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,510
and have the ability to
purchase peer reviews.

60
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,430
So with all that
information, are

61
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,800
we ready to start wire framing?

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,950
Probably not yet.

63
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,810
Before we get started,
we need to understand

64
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,900
who our target audience is.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,320
So let's figure this
out for ChemCraft.

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,340
We need to understand things
like how much work experience

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,550
they have, what their
professional background is,

68
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,960
what their needs
and interests are,

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,669
how they are currently
trying to meet those needs,

70
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,835
and when and where they
would be using this service.

71
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,880
So how can we gather
persona information?

72
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,770
Well, we can start by
making educated assumptions,

73
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,570
we can conduct a focus group,
we can interview current users,

74
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,680
or we can work with a
third party research team

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,210
to gather information.

76
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,920
But we don't have any users yet.

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,350
So how can we gather this
information and organize it?

78
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,360
The answer to this is to
create an assumption persona.

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,660
Once our site is up and running,
and we have real users on it,

80
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,000
we can use the data and
get a clear understanding

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,070
of who our users actually are.

82
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,570
Nevertheless, it is
always a good idea

83
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,242
to create assumption personas
at the beginning of a project.

84
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,700
They will help to
ensure that we're

85
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,074
creating a product
for someone we

86
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,770
believe will actually use it.

87
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,180
So what exactly is a persona?

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,620
Personas are descriptions
of users within our target

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,440
audience.

90
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,870
They generally consist of
a pull quote, an image,

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,240
a fictitious name, a job
title, demographic information,

92
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,035
and their goals
and their concerns.

93
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,399
So let's start with a
pull quote and an image.

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,019
The image helps us
identify with the user,

95
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,339
and the quote should summarize
their needs and goals

96
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,850
into a single sentence,
and it gives a persona

97
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,930
further personality.

98
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,090
Next, we have attributes
like a fictitious name, age,

99
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,260
job title, and general
demographic information.

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,030
This will help us better
understand the user's lifestyle

101
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,860
or work situation.

102
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,220
We also need to think
about the end user's goals,

103
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,750
or what they want to accomplish
when performing tasks

104
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,970
on our website.

105
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,580
This will help us identify their
needs when we build features.

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,900
And finally, we have
a list of concerns.

107
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,830
These, like goals,
are typically a list

108
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,040
of product related concerns from
the end user's point of view.

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,650
We're going to try
to answer questions

110
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,650
like do they have to use
this product for work?

111
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,390
Or will it primarily be
used on a mobile device?

112
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,180
So here's our first persona.

113
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,500
Walter.

114
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,580
He's a department manager, and
he's married with two kids.

115
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,960
We know his reasons
for using the site are

116
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,590
to read about the
latest trends, share

117
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,110
his knowledge with the
chemistry community,

118
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,310
and find people to conduct
peer reviews for him.

119
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,170
We also know he has a need
to co-author articles, read

120
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,970
articles from his iPads,
and he wants the ability

121
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,090
to save articles to read later.

122
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,500
I went ahead and
created another persona.

123
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,800
June.

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,700
So we can see that June
is an intern at DuPont,

125
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,570
and is single with no kids.

126
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,080
She is fresh out of college
and new to the industry.

127
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,900
We also know that she
wants to follow her peers,

128
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,010
get paid to participate
in peer reviewed studies,

129
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,980
and comment on articles
she is reading.

130
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,800
And she wants the ability
to read and write articles

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,020
from her phone as well as be
alerted when new articles are

132
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,250
written by users she follows.

133
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,120
When creating personas, you
want to have a minimum of two,

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,750
and a maximum of four.

135
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,450
Personas give
everyone on the team

136
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,110
a common understanding of
who they're designing for.

137
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,610
When you're working
on your product,

138
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,570
you can ask questions
like will this

139
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,200
solve the problem for June?

140
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,790
Or does this solve a
pain point for Walter?

141
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,410
They make them feel
like real people.

142
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,460
Some other benefits
of creating personas

143
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,510
are they separate
you from your work

144
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,970
and prevent you from assuming
you know what the user wants.

145
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,320
They also allow you to
empathize with the user's needs.

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,800
They provide a focus
for decision making

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,030
and help to
personalize the user,

148
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,120
and they create a
shared understanding

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,150
of who the user is.

150
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,740
So hopefully you can see that
it's very valuable to do this

151
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,830
before we create
our wire frames.

152
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,430
Countless organizations
make decisions every day

153
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,030
based on personas they've
created for their users.

154
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,640
From Apple to Southwest,
and Nike to Spotify.

155
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,190
Now let's work on
some challenges,

156
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,500
and I'll see afterwards.

157
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,260
Good luck.
