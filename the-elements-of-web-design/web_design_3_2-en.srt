1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,710
Welcome back to level three,
section two-- Homepage Design.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,520
Let's get started.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,620
So now that we've hashed
out our main features,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,610
we need to make sure that our
homepage is well-designed.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,480
Users need to be able to
answer these questions.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
What is this?

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,470
What do they have here?

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,000
What can I do here?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,860
Why should I be here?

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,930
And where do I start?

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,610
Let's start with search.

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,170
The search function should
always be prominently featured.

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,640
If we look at the Airbnb
site, we find a custom search

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,380
with added features to
help the users perform

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,200
the necessary tasks to
find a rental property.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,540
On our site, we will add a
standard search field as well

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,980
as a search by category feature.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,510
This will allow users to view
content in a specific category.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,460
Next, we want to
create a tagline.

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,110
A tagline is generally
towards the top of the page

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,030
and explains the product
or service being offered.

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,569
If you look at Bohemian
Coding's Sketch 3 landing page,

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,740
you can see the tagline,
"Professional digital design

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,460
for Mac."

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,360
It's also important to
explain the difference

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,480
between a tagline and a motto.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,810
A motto is generally
used with bigger brands

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,790
and explains the
company's ethics,

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,920
whereas a tagline is explaining
the product or the service.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,370
If we look at Ford's site,
we can see their motto,

31
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,770
"Go Further."

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,860
Since our site is a
new product, a motto

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,130
wouldn't make much sense here.

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,650
So we'll go with a tagline.

35
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,340
But before we mock this up,
let's consider one more thing--

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,090
a welcome statement.

37
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,150
Welcome statements and taglines
tend to overlap at times.

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,040
They are typically
a short description

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,120
of the site displayed
in the upper left

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,090
or upper center of the page.

41
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,100
They tend to be a more complete
and concise explanation

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,920
of the product or service,
and should help guide the user

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
into the next step.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,420
If we look at the user testing
site, we can see the tagline,

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,480
"Give your users a great
experience," paired

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,850
with the welcome statement
of, "Get videos of real people

47
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,920
speaking their thoughts as
they use websites, mobile apps,

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,639
prototypes and more!"

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,150
This quickly explains what the
product is in one sentence.

50
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,130
We will add our tagline,
"Blogging for Chemistry,"

51
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,240
under the logo, and a
welcome statement that

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,810
reads, "Read the latest insights
from the chemistry industry

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,600
or share your own."

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,590
This should clearly explain
what our service is to anyone

55
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,590
who comes to the site.

56
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,440
Another important
feature of the homepage

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,850
is the signup and login feature.

58
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,290
This needs to be prominently
displayed on the web page,

59
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,180
and users need to know
why and how to use it.

60
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,020
Both LinkedIn and Facebook
have large signup forms

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,990
at the top of the page that
show up when the users are not

62
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,840
logged in.

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,030
It's critical for
both of these sites

64
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,740
to make it as easy as
possible to sign up.

65
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,010
Because without an account,
you cannot participate.

66
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,330
While it is not necessary
to sign up for an account

67
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,320
to view our content, it
is still an important part

68
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,520
of our site being that
users need to create

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,440
content for others to read.

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,530
So we will create a
signup section just

71
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,460
below the header
that is displayed

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,420
if the user is not logged in.

73
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,970
Let's give them multiple
ways to sign up,

74
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,120
as well as an option to sign in.

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,240
We need to make sure there is
a clear understanding of why

76
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,570
you would create an account.

77
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,530
We can accomplish this with the
"Add to the Conversation" text.

78
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,920
By doing this, we hope to make
it easy as possible for users

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,920
to get involved.

80
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,900
Another important
feature of the homepage

81
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,950
is time-sensitive content.

82
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,900
This shows users that the
site is active and updated

83
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
frequently.

84
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,550
If we look at The
New Yorker site,

85
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,650
we clearly see The
Latest section.

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,300
And every article under
it shows a date and time

87
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,770
stamp that shows how current
or relevant that content is.

88
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,460
On our site, we will add
a "Top Stories" section

89
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,510
to show what
content is trending.

90
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,400
And below each title we
will display a time stamp

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,960
to show users that the content
is recent and relevant.

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,390
Lastly, you should always
have a way for users

93
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,570
to discover new content
and features without having

94
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,920
to come back to the page.

95
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,550
You can do this typically
with a newsletter.

96
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,990
This will help users to
re-engage with your product

97
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,829
without actually having
to come back to the site.

98
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,850
If you look at both
MaterialUp and CSS tricks,

99
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,030
they both give you the option to
sign up for a newsletter, where

100
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,125
they send you the latest
content to your email,

101
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,410
in hopes of re-engagement.

102
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,280
We will use the same model
by adding a newsletter signup

103
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,070
to our page.

104
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,830
We will clearly state what
you get-- the top five

105
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,240
stories of the week.

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,540
It tells users how frequently
they will receive emails--

107
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,740
weekly.

108
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,820
And it tells the user that
they will never be spammed.

109
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,320
Awesome.

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,510
We have our homepage.

111
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,120
It's clean, clear,
and straightforward.

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,709
Typically, if I go
to a website and I

113
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,250
don't understand
what I'm looking at,

114
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,820
I get frustrated and leave.

115
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,230
But if I go to the website
and it's clear what to do

116
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,070
and what services
they provide, I'm

117
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,560
more likely to have a
successful experience.

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,020
Steve Krug calls this "the big
bang theory of web design."

119
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,970
The idea is, the first few
seconds you spend on a website

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,110
or web page are critical.

121
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,720
The homepage should be focused.

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,340
If you try and get a user's
attention with 100 things,

123
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,720
they won't know what to look at.

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,270
Try to focus on one or two
things and direct them to it.

125
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,840
That's it.

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,825
We have our homepage.

127
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:24,450
So let's do some challenges, and
I'll see you in section three.

128
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,180
Good luck.
