1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,450
Hello and welcome back to level
three, section three-- Pricing

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,110
Pages.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,700
Let's get started.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,970
Now that our peer review
feature is doing better,

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,940
we want to expand the offer
and create tiered pricing.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,200
This will help different
people with different needs

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,100
have access to the peer review
and get people on a budget

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,530
some different options.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,500
The first thing we need to do
is make sure page influences

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,210
decision.

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,260
There are a few ways we can
do this-- offer content that

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,350
answers a person's
question and helps

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,160
to make an informed choice.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,380
Here we can see the
price clearly displayed

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,830
at the top and everything that
we will get in a bullet form

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,870
beneath it.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,710
We can also influence decision
by offering recommendations.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,500
Users value advice from experts.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,380
We will do this by
clearly displaying

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,090
our most popular option
and encouraging people

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,550
to get started for free.

22
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,970
We will also describe
the benefits.

23
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,220
People want to know
what's in it for them.

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,530
This might include extrinsic
rewards like money, rebates,

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,170
or helping users get published.

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,350
You can also appeal to a
user's intrinsic motivations

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,310
and values.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,060
The TOMS website does this
by helping people in need

29
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,800
with the purchase
of a pair of shoes.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,270
You can also influence users
by reframing the message.

31
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,100
You can push people towards
a specific choice using

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,370
scarcity, social motivators,
social comparison,

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,430
and social proof.

34
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,100
Here you can see we
will use social proof

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,810
by creating testimonials that
display beneath the pricing

36
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,230
table.

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,970
Take a look at
Indiegogo's website.

38
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,890
It uses several methods
to influence our decisions

39
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,160
to back a project.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,620
Donation recommendations
are reinforced

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,640
with behavioral
science techniques--

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,520
like social proof with how
many people have pledged

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,760
and scarcity with
a limited time.

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,060
After a person has made
the decision to act,

45
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,720
the next step is
to help them follow

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,090
through-- making the action
as easy and barrier-free as

47
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,090
possible.

48
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,040
One way is try for free.

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,390
Also, you want to shape the
experience in a way that

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,139
facilitates action.

51
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,100
Common techniques include
walkthroughs, callouts, ,

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,624
and pre-determined defaults.

53
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:14,165
Here, we are splitting
up our content

54
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,370
into small actionable chunks.

55
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,560
This makes it more
approachable and more likely

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,910
that the user will
complete the process.

57
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,990
You can also encourage
people to plan,

58
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,160
set goals, and
commit to actions.

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,310
Send reminders.

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,640
Follow up on their
progress over time.

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,570
It's important that you trigger
actions at the right moment.

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,969
Timing is critical.

63
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,260
You should always trigger
people to take an action when

64
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,740
they're able to and want to.

65
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,920
For example, users need
to create an account

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,400
to post articles.

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,860
So when the new user is
interested in contributing

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,670
to the site and clicks
on the "Write an Article"

69
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,240
button, a modal will drop
down asking them to sign-up.

70
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,250
The user is free
to explore the site

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,850
and read as much as they want.

72
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,002
And we will never try
to make them sign-up.

73
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,460
Only when they want
to do something

74
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,130
that requires an
account, we we'll

75
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,520
ask for their information.

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,390
Two more concepts
we should consider

77
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,450
when creating pricing
pages are the paradox

78
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,620
of choice and
progressive disclosure.

79
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,200
This will help reduce the
cognitive load on the user

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,670
and help facilitate action.

81
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,650
The more options
you offer someone,

82
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,470
the harder it is
for them to choose.

83
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,450
This is called the
paradox of choice.

84
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,700
If the user can't
decide, they will leave.

85
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,070
Choosing from three
things is much easier

86
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,310
and will increase the chances of
the user deciding and following

87
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,030
through.

88
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,980
According to Jakob Nielsen,
on the average web page,

89
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,280
users have time to read
at most 28% of the words

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
during an average visit.

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,195
20% is more likely.

92
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,610
Progressive disclosure means
that we reduce page details

93
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,460
to a minimum.

94
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,990
We only show the basic content.

95
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,860
This will help users
facilitate their objectives.

96
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,260
Make sure to only show what
is necessary on each screen.

97
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,320
If people are
making a choice, try

98
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,290
to only show them
enough information

99
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,260
to allow them to
make that choice.

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,590
Avoid the tendency to over
explain or show everything

101
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,230
all at once.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,040
Most people will only
consider the choices

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,700
they are offered-- even if
other possibilities exist.

104
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,820
All choices should
bring the user closer

105
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,910
to their goal as well as ours.

106
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,110
Then we can help lead a
user to the choices that

107
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,577
are best for them.

108
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,910
Keep these things in mind
when creating your own pricing

109
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,626
pages.

110
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:23,750
Now let's get our hands
dirty with some challenges.

111
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,041
And I'll see you in level four.

112
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,714
Good luck.
