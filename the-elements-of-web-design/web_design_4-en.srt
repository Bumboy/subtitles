00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,220
[SINGING] No one's buying all your widgets,
and you're losing people quick.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,610
They're lost inside
your website,

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,300
and they don't know
where to click.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,320
If you had learned
about your users,

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,190
you'd know where you went wrong.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,200
They'd be engaging
with your content,

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,220
and I wouldn't sing this song.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,920
User-centered
design helps improve

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,200
communication,
navigation, pagination,

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,876
Architect your information.

11
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:31,390
Add a motto or a tagline,
with search so they can find,

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,530
A better website is defined
with The Elements of Web Design.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,580
Welcome back to The Elements of
Web Design, level four, section

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,660
one, Mobile Best Practices.

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,350
Let's get started.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,920
If we look back at
our personas, we

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,340
can clearly see that our users
want a great mobile experience,

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,310
but where do we start?

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,030
We start by ensuring that
our website is responsive.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,660
If a user visits our web page
on a desktop or a mobile device,

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,818
they need to have the
same positive experience.

22
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:07,420
If you would like to learn
more about responsive design,

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,810
I would suggest the Code School
course, Journey Into Mobile.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,450
It's a great starting
point to learn

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,930
more about responsive design.

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,360
It's important that when
you're creating a mobile app

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,220
to go along with
your web product,

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,630
that the experience
on the app is

29
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,160
consistent with the
experience on the website.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,710
This will ensure users
know how to use the product

31
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,210
with little explanation.

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,980
Although our interface may
change between devices,

33
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,840
we need to ensure that our
content is seamless across all.

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,830
For example, when you read
an article on the mobile app,

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,030
it appears in the Recently
Read Articles on the web app.

36
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,310
It's important that you
design for the user's context

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,710
and not for the device.

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,520
We need to look at
the who, what, when,

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,360
and where to understand
their context.

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,160
For example, we know our
users want to read articles

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,700
from the app, but
they would also

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,650
like to create and
publish articles,

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,090
so we need to build
a feature for that.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,090
One way we can improve
the mobile experience

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,158
is by allowing the user to
access the device's hardware.

46
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,699
If they're working
on a article, they

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,410
could use the camera
to take a picture

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,179
to show what they're working on.

49
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,720
One thing we should think about,
whether we're building a web

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,110
app or a mobile app, are icons.

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,360
There are really only three
icons globally recognized.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,060
It's the house button for home.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,160
It's the magnifying
glass for search.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,360
And it's the printer for print.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,500
To ensure users understand
the icon, it's best practice

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,320
to include a text
label when possible.

57
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,970
A site can really benefit
from having good icons.

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,460
Icons make good targets.

59
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,274
They're typically
large enough to touch.

60
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:41,690
They're also great
because they're

61
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,700
fast to recognize at a glance.

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,750
And icons can be
visually pleasing,

63
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,100
and enhance the overall
aesthetic appeal of our design.

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,840
When creating
icons, you typically

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,037
want to keep the design
simple and always

66
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,120
test them with your users.

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,910
Because icons are
generally small,

68
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,560
you don't want to
use a lot of detail.

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,070
Here, you can see the difference
between two book icons.

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,590
Let's look at the Blinkist app.

71
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,180
It uses clean, simple
icons with labels

72
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,600
to help users quickly learn
and understand the app.

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,290
External triggers can
be used to engage users.

74
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,010
They live in the
user's environment

75
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,530
and they help motivate
them to take action.

76
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,330
A good example of
an external trigger

77
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,600
is using the social
buttons on an article

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,320
to tweet about what
they've just read.

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,620
Internal triggers can play
into external triggers as well.

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,490
Say a friend of yours
tweets that they just

81
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,960
read an awesome
article about inks

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
being used to create circuits.

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,382
Since you trust your
friend's opinion,

84
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,340
you're more likely to
engage with that content.

85
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,550
Successful products do a great
job of triggering our emotions.

86
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,890
When I complete a run on
Runkeeper, I feel accomplished.

87
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,740
When someone likes a post
on Twitter, I feel happy.

88
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,920
When I'm uncertain about
a piece of information,

89
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,780
I could always Google it.

90
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,510
Good triggers prompt action,
while vague ones, just

91
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,690
annoy users.

92
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,090
It's important that there's a
clear action to the trigger.

93
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,030
The trigger we set up in our
mobile app occurs when a user

94
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,230
we follow posts a new article.

95
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,760
We get a push notification
that we can swipe,

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,250
and it will take us to
the article to read it.

97
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,230
This is a good, simple
personalized message

98
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,330
with a clear action.

99
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,850
Another attribute of
a good notification

100
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,610
is to create intrigue.

101
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,470
One way we can do this is by
notifying users of the most

102
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,540
commented articles of the week.

103
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,220
This will be tempting to engage
with because the user will

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,260
want to know what
everyone is talking about.

105
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,930
It plays into our basic
human sense of curiosity.

106
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,550
With all that said, the most
important aspect of the app

107
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,170
is how we onboard users.

108
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,300
If the onboarding is
difficult or annoying,

109
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,365
no one will ever know
how cool our app is.

110
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,740
But there are a
few things we can

111
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,580
do to help users
get into the app

112
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,340
and understand how to use it.

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,910
The first thing we need to
do is make the signup process

114
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,220
as simple and easy as possible.

115
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,360
One way we can do this
is to ask for users

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,020
to enter their email
if they want to login.

117
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,140
Then we can send them an
email with the link that

118
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,540
logs them into the app.

119
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,140
This way if the user
has a complex password,

120
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,150
they don't have to enter
it with their thumbs.

121
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,030
Another way to add ease to
the onboarding experience

122
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,670
is to create a
self-paced tutorial

123
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,370
where users can understand the
primary functions of the app

124
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,170
and quickly get acclimated.

125
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,880
Make sure you're only showing
the most important actions they

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,790
will need to perform right away.

127
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,170
The more advanced features
can be explained later

128
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,230
when the user has become
more familiar with the app.

129
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,480
When utilizing the
tutorial approach,

130
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,410
make sure to use
a big, bold button

131
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,700
to guide users through the app.

132
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,760
Each view should have
one clear primary action

133
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,120
the user needs to take.

134
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,820
Guide them every
step of the way.

135
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,420
Get them excited.

136
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,930
For our tutorial, once
the user is in the app,

137
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,880
we will show them a list of top
thought leaders for the user

138
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
to start following.

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,140
This will help
personalize the content

140
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,850
to the user's interests.

141
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,784
Now keep in mind a lot of
this is best practices.

142
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,200
It's always important
to remember,

143
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,840
whenever you design
anything, you

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,280
want to get it in front
of users, test the idea,

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,375
and validate it.

146
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,750
This will ensure that your
product is on the right track.

147
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,485
And this is the basic principle
of a user-centered design

148
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:20,985
approach.

149
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,660
Thanks for taking The
Elements of Web Design course.

150
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,076
Now we have a few
more challenges,

151
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,921
and I'll see you in
the wrap-up video.

152
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,920
Can I do that one again?

153
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,030
I kind of ended it like, mreh.

154
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,930
What's the motto?

155
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:38,610
I don't know.

156
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,820
What's the motto with you?

157
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,800
That's a joke.

158
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,290
[LAUGHTER]

159
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,890
If we-- I got the joke now.

160
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,440
[LAUGHTER]
