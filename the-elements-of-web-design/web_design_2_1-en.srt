1
00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:02,300
[Singing] No one's
buying all your widgets,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,500
and you're losing people quick.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,610
They're lost inside
your website,

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,680
and they don't know
where to click.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,320
If you had learned
about your users,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,190
you'd know where you went wrong.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,200
They'd be engaging
with your content,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,195
and I wouldn't sing this song.

9
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,110
User centered
design helps improve

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,700
communication, navigation,
pagination, architect

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,900
your information.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,390
Add a motto or tagline, with
search so they can find,

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,855
A better website is defined
with the Elements of Web Design.

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,342
Welcome back to the
Elements of Web Design.

15
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:41,758
In level two, we're
going to start

16
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,290
with information architecture.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,170
So let's get started.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,816
Now that our site is
really taking off,

19
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,440
we want to organize our content
into what is called information

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,370
architecture.

21
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,410
This is the process of
organizing and labeling

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,770
the content to make it
easier for users to find.

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,360
Information architecture
is all around us.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,980
If we look at this train
map in the city of Yokohama,

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,900
we can see that all train
routes are organized

26
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,540
into color coded lines.

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,890
We can also see that all
transfer stations are clearly

28
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,390
labeled, and all stops
are clearly labeled.

29
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,900
This makes it easy
for passengers

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,460
to get from one side of
the city to the other.

31
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,910
Airport signage uses
information architecture

32
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,730
to help passengers find
where they need to go.

33
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,730
They do this by putting
the primary action

34
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,670
in the center of the sign using
large text and secondary action

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,450
towards the outer sides of
the sign in smaller text.

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,310
They also use iconography
to help non-English speaking

37
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,820
people find where
they would like to go.

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,860
Our website's
information architecture

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,610
needs to help you find
the content they're

40
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,880
looking for in the
four primary ways

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,060
that users generally
search the web.

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,930
The first is known items-- this
is when we know what we want

43
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,570
and we know where to find it.

44
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,680
The second is
exploratory-- this is

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,090
when we know what we want but
we're not really sure where

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,200
to find it.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,290
Good labeling comes
into play here.

48
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,870
The third is
unknown-- this is when

49
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,270
we don't know enough about
what we're looking for,

50
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,250
and we're not sure
how to search for it.

51
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,210
And the last is
re-finding-- this

52
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,620
is when we're looking for
content we've already seen.

53
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,520
Let's take a look at
a real-world example

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,260
for each of these--
starting with known items.

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,670
If I know what
I'm searching for,

56
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,910
I could use A to
Z index navigation

57
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,590
to find the specific thing
that I'm looking for.

58
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,100
Search is also a good tool since
users know specifically what

59
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,440
they're looking for.

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,095
And lastly, quick
links can be used

61
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,720
to help users find
what they're looking

62
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,580
for is quick as possible.

63
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,360
If we know what we
want but we're not sure

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,020
where to find it, we
can explore the website.

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,720
Search, again, is a
great tool for this,

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,400
because it helps users find
what they're looking for.

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,060
Navigation is important,
because if the user doesn't

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,940
know exactly what
they're looking for,

69
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,430
they probably have a
good idea of where to start.

70
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,360
And related information can help
users find content that they

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,410
may also be interested in.

72
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,745
If we need to find something
we don't know much about

73
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:58,590
or where it's located, we might
need to use the unknown search

74
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
method.

75
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,220
There are two ways we can do
this-- with simple language

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,140
and customer communication.

77
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,860
Simple language
helps users find what

78
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,340
they're looking for through
basic nontechnical labeling.

79
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,270
Customer communication,
or personal communication,

80
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,970
is a powerful tool for companies
that offer complex services.

81
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,810
Clearly giving people the
ability to reach out to someone

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,060
and get help puts users at
ease and helps them find

83
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,040
the resources that they need.

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,070
The fourth method
for finding content

85
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,240
is re-finding-- looking for
content we've already seen.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
If we look at my
Amazon profile, I

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,946
could see my recent
shopping history.

88
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:37,870
Now that we understand
how people find content,

89
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,600
we can start creating
our website's information

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,890
architecture.

91
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,380
Often when organizing a site,
people will use Post-it notes

92
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,370
to define and label pages.

93
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,010
This allows them to stick
to post it notes on the wall

94
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,630
and visually see the
site's structure.

95
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,550
Let's take a look at how
to do this on our website.

96
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,980
First, let's
identify our content.

97
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,650
We need to put all of our
pages on individual cards--

98
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,820
like this.

99
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,220
Now, we can sort them into
piles of similar pages.

100
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,540
This is an exercise you
can do with real users.

101
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,950
Have your users organize
the cards in a way

102
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,270
they understand it.

103
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,240
Then have them organize the
piles in order of significance.

104
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,390
Run this test with
five to eight users

105
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,500
and look for
correlating patterns.

106
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
With the results
from our users, we

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,510
can now see how they see
the site being laid out.

108
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,920
The cards highlighted in
green are our top level pages

109
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
and will most
likely be the links

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,050
in our persistent navigation.

111
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,080
Now we can start
building our sitemap.

112
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,570
Sitemaps are like a floor
plan for our website.

113
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,340
It gives us a visual
representation

114
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,010
of the site's organization
and how different sections

115
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,920
are linked together.

116
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,400
Support, articles, and
dashboard will make up

117
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,820
our persistent navigation.

118
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,240
And we will use the logo to
link back to the homepage.

119
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,050
Now that our top
level pages are set

120
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,420
as the persistent
navigation, we need

121
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,330
to add the rest of our
content to the sitemap.

122
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,260
This will be the sub-pages that
are under our primary content.

123
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,290
Once you've got a good sitemap
in hand, everyone on the team

124
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,020
can use it to reference and
stay synced up while they're

125
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,500
working on the site.

126
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,140
The hierarchy of the
information in a sitemap

127
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,510
tells us two things--
what sections

128
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,620
will need to be in the primary
and secondary navigation

129
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,340
and where intersection
paths will

130
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,922
need to be added to make
the appropriate sections

131
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:27,880
of the site accessible.

132
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,030
When you're reviewing
a sitemap, make

133
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,500
sure all important
sections, subsections,

134
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,020
and pages are represented.

135
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,040
Now that our secondary content
is added to the sitemap,

136
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,050
you may ask, how do we add
that content to the page?

137
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,980
The answer is with
secondary navigation.

138
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,390
This navigation only appears
in the article section

139
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,600
of our site.

140
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,570
In this case, our
sidebar navigation

141
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,800
is allowing us to filter our
article feed by category.

142
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
If we were to click
on the dashboard,

143
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,180
this navigation would go
away and display the content

144
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,595
associated with dashboard.

145
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:07,810
One of the biggest
problems on the web

146
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,430
is understanding where you
are in context to everything

147
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,570
that's on the site.

148
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,420
One way to combat
this issue is to make

149
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,160
it clear by highlighting or
using active states on links

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,740
of the pages you are on.

151
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,250
These location markers should
be easy for users to see.

152
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,580
When we look at the location
markers on the website,

153
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,260
we can see that it follows
along with the sitemap.

154
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,949
From the homepage, we
enter the article page.

155
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,490
And then from the
article page, we've

156
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,357
gone into the polymer page.

157
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,190
This will help give us
a clear understanding

158
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,380
of where we are within the
information architecture.

159
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,750
So at this point,
our website consist

160
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,170
of three primary sections--
the persistent navigation,

161
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,220
the sidebar navigation, and
the actual page content.

162
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,970
Something you will
want to make a habit of

163
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,730
is displaying the page
title for your web page.

164
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,460
You should always display
a title for your web page.

165
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,950
This should always
match the name

166
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,790
of the length that was
selected to get to that page.

167
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,030
The title needs to
frame the page content

168
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,850
below the persistent navigation
but above the actual content.

169
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,190
Below the page title is
the actual page content--

170
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,150
like these articles
associated with polymer.

171
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,220
This is our visual hierarchy.

172
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,400
We have four main sections--
persistent navigation,

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,460
sidebar navigation, a
page title, and then

174
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,370

Here on REI's site, you
can see the same structure.

176
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:35,240
They have the
persistent navigation

177
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,160
at the top, the
sidebar navigation

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,430
to the left, a page title,
and then all the page content

179
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,690
below that.

180
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,040
The benefits of information
architecture are twofold.

181
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,892
They help us organize our pages
and create our navigation--

182
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,600
which we did through
creating the sitemap

183
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,897
and laying out our pages.

184
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,480
And the benefits are they help
our users understand where they

185
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,919
are and where they need to go.

186
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,210
Why don't you try playing
with information architecture

187
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,990
in the challenges.

188
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,310
And I'll see you in
the next section.
