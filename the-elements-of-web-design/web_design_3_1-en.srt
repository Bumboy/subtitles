00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,810
[SINGING] No one's
buying all your widgets,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,031
and you're losing people quick.

3
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:07,970
They're lost inside
your website, and they

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,740
don't know where to click.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,880
If you had learned
about your users,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,400
you'd know where you went wrong.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,500
They'd be engaging
with your content,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,210
and I wouldn't sing this song.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,230
User-centered design helps
improve communication,

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,160
navigation, pagination,

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,068
Architect your information.

12
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:31,370
Add a motto or a tagline,
with search so they can find,

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:38,450
A better website is defined
with The Elements of Web Design.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,480
Welcome back to Level
Three, Section One, Forms.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,370
Let's get started.

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,420
We need to create our
peer review feature,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,610
and it starts with a form.

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,850
So what happens when
we click this button?

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,410
So let's create the form.

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,460
A great way to start
is by sketching.

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,790
Let's add in all the content
we think we need for the form.

22
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,820
OK, great.

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,580
So now we've implemented our
form, but there's a problem.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,670
Users are saying that
it's hard to use.

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,980
We understand that when
they're looking at the form,

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,150
their eyes are moving
in a zigzag pattern.

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,330
This is making it hard
to read the form, which

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,760
makes it hard for users
to engage with the form.

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,680
To fix this, we will move the
labels above the input fields.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,740
This makes it easy
for users to read down

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,630
the form in a list-like pattern.

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,960
The easier it is to use
the form, the more likely

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,898
they will be to engage with it.

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,660
The next thing we need to do is
remove any unnecessary fields.

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,880
Since the users
need to be logged in

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,590
to participate in
the peer reviews,

37
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,920
we don't need to ask for
their first and last names.

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,170
We can also remove
the Location field,

39
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,630
since it's irrelevant
to what we're asking.

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,870
Removing any unnecessary
fields increases the likelihood

41
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,480
that users will actually
engage with the form.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,980
All right.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,590
Now that we've
simplified the form,

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,430
it's much more
attractive to fill out.

45
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,590
We've removed any
unnecessary fields.

46
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,380
We've improved the readability.

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,820
And we've added the user
account information to it.

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,360
This is a great improvement
to the form's usability.

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,850
Making required fields
generally results in users

50
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,980
skipping optional fields.

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,360
But by making
optional fields, users

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,970
are generally more inclined to
fill out the form completely.

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,230
It's a best practice to avoid
creating required fields.

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,480
If a field isn't required,
just make it optional.

55
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,280
People are more likely
to fill it out anyways.

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,490
If the user runs into
an issue with the form,

57
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,240
an error should be displayed.

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,500
Keep in mind that the error text
should be clear and helpful.

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,960
Never blame the user.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,820
It's important to
understand the error.

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,824
We need to give them
contextual feedback.

62
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:45,240
There are a number
of ways you can

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,300
ask a user for their information
when you're creating a form.

64
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,600
Let's take a look at our form.

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,370
It looks like we
have two options.

66
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,290
No, I'd rather not
receive the newsletter,

67
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,370
and Yes, sign me up
for the newsletter.

68
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,210
That looks a little confusing.

69
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,490
We're asking the user
to read this information

70
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,620
and make a decision.

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,280
It's less likely that they're
going to click on anything.

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,500
This is where explicit
choice comes into play.

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,490
Research has shown that when
a default choice is offered,

74
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,000
most people do not
deviate from it.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
So in our form, we have
the newsletter pre-checked

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,990
for the user, making
far more likely

77
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,780
that the user will opt into it.

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,590
The decision has simply
been made for them.

79
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,804
This is called explicit choice.

80
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,970
Now let's think about the
buttons we want to create.

81
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,600
We want to make sure
users understand

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,180
why they're clicking
it, and what's

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,600
going to happen after they do.

84
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,740
A few things to keep in
mind when creating buttons

85
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,920
are, younger and
older users generally

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,380
tend to have a hard time
targeting the mouse.

87
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,330
We want to make sure buttons
are large and easy to click.

88
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,950
For example, the top four
buttons are very big.

89
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,390
They have a lot of space where
you can target the mouse.

90
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,770
Where the bottom two
aren't quite as easy.

91
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,130
There's not a lot of padding
on the one to the right,

92
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,370
and the one to the left
is just an underline.

93
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,650
These are less
likely to be clicked.

94
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,280
We also want to
try and avoid using

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,270
confusing or cutesy terms.

96
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,370
Links should be very
clearly labeled,

97
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,580
and users should
undoubtedly understand

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,380
what will happen after
they click the link.

99
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,930
And always make sure
you use the hand cursor

100
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,589
when a user hovers over a link,
so as to signify the button

101
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,510
is clickable.

102
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,400
If you hover over your button
and the pointer doesn't appear,

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,640
you can use the
cursor property in CSS

104
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,122
if you're familiar with it.

105
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:31,020
With certain forms, confirmation
messages can be very useful.

106
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,180
But it's important
not to overuse them.

107
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,370
You should never use
a confirmation message

108
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,460
when you can easily give
the user the option to undo.

109
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,800
It's best to use the
confirmation message

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
when the user is doing
something that's irreversible.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,700
For example on
Skype, the user must

112
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,100
confirm that they want
to mute the conversation.

113
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,080
If the user didn't realize
they muted the conversation,

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,550
you may think there's an issue
with Skype and get frustrated.

115
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,760
Apple uses a
confirmation message

116
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,540
when a user tries to
delete older messages

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,780
from the messaging app.

118
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,670
This is to ensure users
understand exactly what will

119
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,880
happen when they do
this, and prevent them

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,830
from accidentally deleting
information that is important.

121
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,980
We will use a confirmation
message on the peer review form

122
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,705
when users are checking out.

123
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,830
This will let them know
that they are being charged

124
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,210
and will help prevent
user confusion in dealing

125
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,130
with accidental
checkouts and refunds.

126
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,430
We want our users to feel
a sense of accomplishment

127
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,610
when they fill out the form,
so we'll congratulate them.

128
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,950
This is called a mini win.

129
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,800
It will help reassure
them that the task was

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,630
completed correctly,
and condition

131
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,180
them to continue the behavior.

132
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,460
Finally, let's talk
about accessibility.

133
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,480
Accessibility refers
to making your web

134
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,040
page more usable for
everyone, including

135
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,480
people with disabilities.

136
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,990
It's a huge subject and
shares responsibility

137
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,070
between design and development.

138
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,220
At the very least, let's
consider these three things.

139
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,920
Never put text in an image.

140
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,030
Screen readers should
be able to tell the user

141
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,070
everything they need
to know without having

142
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,540
to fill out the form.

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Avoid low contrast
text and input fields.

144
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,010
It makes it hard on people with
bad vision or color blindness.

145
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,040
Make sure all fields are
laid out in a logical way,

146
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,880
asking for the right
information at the right time.

147
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,450
And always, always,
always test your forms

148
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,000
with accessibility tools.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,790
One of my favorites is Wave.

150
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,790
You can paste your URL
at wave.webaim.org.

151
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,970
It will return a lot
of valuable information

152
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,420
to ensure everyone has a
great experience on your site.

153
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,610
You can also test your site
with the Color Contrast Analyzer

154
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,220
tool.

155
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,170
This looks at all the
colors on your website

156
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,150
and measures the
difference between them.

157
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,370
If there's not enough contrast,
the edges don't light up,

158
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,800
and you may want to increase
the color contrast there.

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,603
All right, that's the
end of Section One.

160
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,186
Let's go try some
challenges, and I'll

161
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:54,440
see you in Section Two.

162
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,427
.
