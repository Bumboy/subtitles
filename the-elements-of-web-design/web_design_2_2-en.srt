1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,912
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:04,870
Now let's get started on
Section Two, Navigation.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,370
All right, our site
is doing great.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,180
We have tons of people
writing articles,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,514
but it's creating a problem.

6
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,930
It's becoming harder for users
to find the content they're

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,970
looking for.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,530
We could use navigation
to solve this.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,830
Let's first look at our
persistent navigation.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,420
As we pointed out
in the last section,

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,130
we should have a logo that
links back to the home page.

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,980
We should also have a
top level navigation.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,840
And now we've added
a utility navigation.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,010
This includes utilities
like Login and Contact,

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,470
which are links to parts
of the site that aren't

16
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,210
part of our content hierarchy.

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,890
It's a good rule of
thumb to only accommodate

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,620
fortified utility links in
the persistent navigation.

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,120
And lastly, you always
want to incorporate

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,975
a search function which should
be at the top of every page.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,135
Now that our persistent
navigation is in good shape,

22
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,980
we should also include
a descriptor navigation

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,370
on the home page.

24
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,220
This will give people
coming to the site

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,430
the ability to quickly
start interacting

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,720
with the content
that interests them.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,500
This is commonly
seen on the web.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,820
If we look at the
Smashing Magazine site,

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,720
we can see that they
separate their content

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,370
into topics of interest
like Coding, Design, Mobile,

31
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,310
and Graphics.

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,760
Spotify does this as
well by organizing

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,940
their content into genres like
Mood, Party, Pop, and work out.

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,460
When it comes to
the dashboard, we

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,685
want to focus on a
verb-based navigation.

36
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,310
This is a good choice
for the dashboard

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,340
because a lot of the
links are actionable.

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,470
For example, the right link
in the top right corner.

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,430
You frequently see
verb-based navigation

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,370
on financial sites using words
like Invest, Bank, Trading.

41
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,030
And we also need a
user-based navigation.

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,010
This helps users find
content based on their needs.

43
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,020
In our case, we will
define two types

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,840
of users, people that
have done a study and need

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,670
people to peer
review, as well as

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,090
people that want to get paid to
help someone with their study.

47
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,620
User-based navigation
is a common convention

48
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,420
of pricing pages, where
pricing is divided out

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,314
based on the user's needs.

50
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,730
On the Litmus the
site, we can see

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,710
that they use Premium, Plus, and
Basic to create their user base

52
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,930
navigation.

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,000
It's also important to keep
in mind that some users prefer

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,490
to use Search or some prefer to
use the persistent navigation.

55
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,710
They're split about 50-50.

56
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,250
In the case of Apple,
they know that some people

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,300
want to explore and use
the persistent navigation

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,730
while others know exactly
what they're searching for

59
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,740
and should probably
use the search.

60
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,540
Keep in mind that
people are also

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,370
influenced by the size
of the search field.

62
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,900
Smaller search fields will
get one word searches,

63
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,970
while longer fields will
typically get phrases.

64
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,650
Now that our site is
easier to navigate,

65
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,900
we need to make it easier
for them to find the content

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,180
that they're looking for.

67
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,490
But why is this important?

68
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,410
It turns out research has
shown that people usually

69
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,780
see a very small number of
items in each search result set.

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,650
As Jakob Nielsen wrote in
Prioritizing Web Usability,

71
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,690
"Viewing frequency drops off
rapidly after the first page.

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,800
More than half of all
users didn't scroll at all.

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,050
So only 42% of users
will see any information

74
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,650
on the second screen.

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,810
So we need to provide a means
of moving content the user is

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,260
looking for to the first page."

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,700
One way we can do
this is by sorting.

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,700
In our case it is Recent,
Popular, and Most Commented.

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,320
It is important to keep in mind
that sorting does not remove

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,910
entries from the data set.

81
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,900
It only puts the
data in a new order.

82
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,930
Filtering, on the other hand,
is useful in a different way.

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,020
Filtering actually
reduces the amount

84
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,590
of content being displayed.

85
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,820
We will be using our
top six categories

86
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,430
to filter our content.

87
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,440
With both methods
being used together,

88
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,730
users can quickly find the
most popular physical articles

89
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,400
or the most recent polymer
articles in just two clicks.

90
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,720
Another powerful method
for sorting our content

91
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,100
is with meta filters.

92
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,120
This is also called tagging.

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,660
When users can tag their own
content with relevant keywords,

94
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,649
it makes the content
more searchable.

95
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,360
We can tag articles with the
writer's name, school, or work,

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,230
so that users can just search
articles from Stanford,

97
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,400
or just search articles
written by Jacqueline Olson.

98
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,350
Meta tagging is extremely
powerful on commerce sites

99
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,960
with a lot of content.

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,900
For example, Urban
Outfitters allows

101
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,180
users to filter
information based

102
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,090
on the article of
clothing, color, or brand.

103
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,440
This allows users to filter out
items they're not interested in

104
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,380
and moves the items
they are interested

105
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,390
in to the front page.

106
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,000
Even with the ability
to reduce content,

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,460
we will still need
a way of dealing

108
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,610
with a large list of content.

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,910
Pagination is a
universal option.

110
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,330
So we will use pagination to
give users the sense of control

111
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,870
and make it easier for
them to access the results.

112
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,510
Plus, Google search uses
pagination, like you see here.

113
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,344
We can also use
tabs for sorting.

114
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,760
They clean up the
page and they're

115
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,010
easy for people to understand.

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,990
To summarize, top
navigation standards

117
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,290
help users find what
they're looking for.

118
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,520
Descriptor navigations
help with page discovery.

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
You should use
verbs in navigation

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,180
for actionable links.

121
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,800
Navigation links and search
are equally important.

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,510
Sorting and filtering help
connect users to content.

123
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,675
And tabs can really
help clean up a page.

124
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,420
So now that we know a little
more about navigation,

125
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,300
let's do some challenges and
I'll see you in the next level.

126
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,180
SERPS uses--

127
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,780
SERPS.

128
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,469
SERPS is such a weird word.

129
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,510
I'm going to be a much
better speaker after this,

130
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,630
I think, without a doubt.

131
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,880
Was that too marble mouthy?

132
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,220
Homepage design.
