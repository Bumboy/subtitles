1
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:04,100
In this section we're going
to add another directive,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,180
and this time, attach
a controller to it.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,560
So in our previous
section, we had

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,710
this HTML we encapsulated
into an attribute directive,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,910
and an element directive.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,060
Here's some additional code
that we can encapsulate

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,170
into a directive,
but you'll notice

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,550
it also has a controller.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,920
So let's change this
into a directive

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,439
and then figure out how
to add the controller.

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,240
First step, as
you might imagine,

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,562
is we're going to take this code
and we're going to pull it out

13
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:38,770
into the product-panels.html.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,670
Inside our index.html
we'll create

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,900
the product-panels
custom directive.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,610
Then our app.js will start
defining the custom directive.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,590
We'll call it productPanels,
notice the camel case,

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,730
it's an element directive.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,420
So we write restrict 'E'.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,520
And the template here is going
to be product-panels.html.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,000
Now how do we move the
controller into the directive?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,790
Well first things
first, we're going

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,410
to move the functionality
of the controller

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,980
into the directive using
the controller keyword.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,380
So we have our
product-panels directive

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,690
with our panel controller
and it works fine.

27
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,550
We would just have to
remember every time

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,630
we add this
product-panels directive

29
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,000
to also include this controller.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,330
So how might we
move this controller

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,080
inside the directive?

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,630
The first thing
we need to do, we

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,690
need to specify that alias
we'll want to use inside

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,280
of this directive to
refer to the controller.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,090
In this case, panels.

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,770
And that's all there is to it.

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,410
And we can see that
everything works as it should,

38
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,180
nothing much has changed,
except our HTML has

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,880
become more organized
and expressive.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,850
Time for you to jump
into the challenges.

41
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,290
Try this out and I'll see
you in the next level.
