1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,780
Welcome to App
Evolution with Swift.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,720
I'm Jon Friskics.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,303
And in this course,
you'll be learning

4
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:11,600
how to build your first
simple iOS app with Swift.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,070
Swift is a programming language
that Apple introduced in

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,230
June 2014 for creating
iOS and OS X apps.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,670
Apple has been updating Swift pretty regularly

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,650
with new features and fixes.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,650
And as of the recording
of this course,

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,020
Swift is at version 3.0.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,350
You can still make
apps with Objective-C.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,790
But if you're just starting
to learn iOS development right

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,725
now, it probably makes sense
to learn with Swift first.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,770
In this course, the simple
app we're going to build

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,970
is for the fictional
Good As Old phone

16
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,510
store, an antique
phone shop that sells

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,130
nothing but old telephones.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,650
This app will have the ability
to view a list of old phones,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,630
tap into that list to get
details about each phone,

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,710
and display a message when the
Add to Cart button is tapped.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,330
We'll also have a
contact screen that

22
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,870
contains more content than
will fit on the device

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,290
that you need to
scroll through to read.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,280
As we make the different
parts of this app,

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,610
we're going to be showing
you short screencasts of how

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,640
to work in Xcode, which is the
program that you write apps in.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,880
So feel free to pause the video
and head over to the Mac App

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,510
Store to download Xcode
so you can follow along

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,740
on your own computer.

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,369
Xcode does only run on the Mac.

31
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,410
So if you're following
along with all of the code

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,560
that we're writing, you
will need a Mac in order

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,500
to be able to build an app.

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,980
If you're using a PC
or other computer,

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,480
you can still watch the videos
to see how all of this works.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,740
[SINGING] Starting back
in the machine age,

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,210
the telephone had
just taken the stage.

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,430
No one predicted
its acceleration,

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,810
evolving all of
our communication.

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,480
Today we build with
storyboard, use Xcode projects

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,030
where they're
stored. Controllers

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,596
with scroll, navigating tables,
outlets, actions, buttons,

43
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:57,095
and labels.

44
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,760
To code a phone is a learned
gift with the App Evolution

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,260
with Swift.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,940
Before we start
making an app, there's

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,260
a very important
prerequisite that we need: 

48
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,790
to understand how
to make a sandwich.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,160
No, really, stay with me.

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,830
Making iOS apps is actually
a lot like making a sandwich.

51
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,670
You need a pile of ingredients,
like bread, onions, and cheese,

52
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,750
maybe even some meat.

53
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,660
You also need a place to
prepare those ingredients,

54
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,370
different utensils like
a cutting board, knives,

55
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,730
and forks, maybe
even a plastic bag

56
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,210
to carry it with
you after it's made.

57
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,230
And not every
sandwich is the same.

58
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,650
But unless you can tell the
chef how to make it different,

59
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,210
you won't get the
sandwich you want.

60
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,190
In this analogy, UIKit is like
the parts of the sandwich.

61
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,190
It's a framework that contains
templates for standardized ways

62
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,895
to display data in your app,
like text, images, and buttons.

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,660
Xcode is like the
kitchen and utensils.

64
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,980
It contains all of the
tools you need to assemble

65
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,811
the parts of the sandwich.

66
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,060
It's a free program that's
provided by Apple that they

67
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,440
update a few times each year.

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,490
And Swift is the instructions
for making the sandwich.

69
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,900
You'll write Swift code in
Xcode that tells parts of UIKit

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,170
how to display your data.

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,130
And the chef?

72
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,566
Well, that's you.

73
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,440
So let's get started
by seeing how we

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,230
can create a project in Xcode.

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,730
After you've
downloaded Xcode, you

76
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,800
can open it by double-clicking
on the Xcode app, Alias,

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,490
or by finding it in your
applications folder.

78
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,130
In the splash
screen that pops up,

79
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,667
there's an option for
creating a new Xcode project.

80
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,000
The first thing you're asked
is to choose a new template

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
for your project.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,830
Templates contain some common
starting configurations

83
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,419
for different kinds of apps.

84
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,960
For the app we're
making today, we're

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,780
going to choose Single View
Application because that's

86
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,520
the closest one to a bare
bones, default template,

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,220
and it will be a good
place for us to start.

88
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
Once we click Next,
we're shown a screen

89
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,381
where we can set some
options for our project.

90
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,380
This is where we want to
set the name of our app

91
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,687
for the product name.

92
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:08,020
Here we'll type GoodAsOldPhones.

93
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,430
You want to set the organization
name, which is usually

94
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,140
just your company name,
and then the organization

95
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,480
identifier, which is usually
in the form of com.companyname.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,940
That automatically generates
a bundle identifier,

97
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,987
which is what identifies your
app as unique in the store.

98
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:29,320
We'll make sure we've got
Swift selected in the language

99
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,510
dropdown.

100
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,602
And for the device,
we'll choose iPhone.

101
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,310
That's because the
app we're making today

102
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,840
is only going to
be built to be run

103
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,900
on the iPhone, not a universal
app that runs on iPhone

104
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,710
or iPad.

105
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,690
We'll also leave these
three boxes unchecked

106
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,840
because we won't need any of
these features in our app.

107
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,770
Once we click Next,
we're asked where we

108
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,264
want to save this new project.

109
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,680
Here we'll save
it on the desktop.

110
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,320
After hitting Create, we can see
that Xcode opens up like this.

111
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,930
It might look kind
of intimidating.

112
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,480
But the screen we
see here is just

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,987
showing some general
options for our application.

114
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,070
We don't even need to
change any of these settings

115
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,840
to get started.

116
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,760
On the left, you'll see a panel
with eight icons on the top.

117
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,844
And that first icon contains
the project navigator.

118
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:16,760
This is where all of the
files in your project

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,780
will be displayed.

120
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,700
And you can open up
any one of those files

121
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,880
by single-clicking
on the filename.

122
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
Right now we'll open
up Main.storyboard.

123
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,820
And let's jump back
into some slides

124
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,850
real quick to talk about
what a storyboard is.

125
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,830
A storyboard is a way
to visually lay out

126
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,400
the screens in your
application as scenes

127
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,890
and create templates for
different UI elements

128
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,110
that can later be filled
in with real data.

129
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,230
You can also connect
different scenes together

130
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,930
and model how the user will
flow between them as they

131
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,080
interact with your app.

132
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,110
Each scene contains something
called a view controller that

133
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,390
manages one main view.

134
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,920
And everything else that
you see on the screen

135
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,660
goes inside of that main view.

136
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,460
Let's jump back into Xcode to
play around with the main view

137
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,490
and see if we can change
some of its properties.

138
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,620
To access the main view
for this storyboard,

139
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,580
we need to look in the
Storyboard Scene Editor panel.

140
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,622
If this panel isn't
showing up for you,

141
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:17,080
you can click on this icon at
the bottom left of the Editor

142
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,302
panel to expand and collapse it.

143
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,760
Then we can just
click on the arrow

144
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,779
to expand the View
Controller scene

145
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,320
and then click on
the View Controller

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,050
to expand the View and
Layout Guides inside of it.

147
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,800
The panel on the right is
called the Inspector panel.

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,930
If you don't see it
in your copy of Xcode,

149
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,470
you can click on this far
right icon in the toolbar

150
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,870
to make it appear and disappear.

151
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,060
The Inspector panel
contains six different ways

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,440
you can inspect the
parts of your storyboard.

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,650
Right now we'll click on
the fourth inspector, which

154
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,740
is the Attributes
Inspector, and there's

155
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,720
an attribute for this
view called Background.

156
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,010
If we click on the color
here and pick a new color

157
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,940
from the color
picker that comes up,

158
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,321
we can see that our view
changes color in the storyboard.

159
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,820
We can run this app
right now to see

160
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,100
what it looks like on this
computer using an iPhone

161
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,852
simulator.

162
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,310
You can choose what
device you want

163
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,790
to simulate from this
dropdown in the toolbar.

164
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,360
Here you can see we have
devices ranging from the iPad 2

165
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,030
all the way up to
the iPhone 6s Plus.

166
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,040
We'll choose iPhone
6s because that's

167
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,520
the size we'll be designing for.

168
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,800
Then you can just hit the
Play button in the toolbar,

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,520
and it will build and
run the application

170
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,645
and show you the simulator.

171
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,210
And here you can see the result
of setting the main views

172
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,360
background color to
red in the storyboard.

If you haven't been
following along already,

174
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,970
now's a great time
to jump into Xcode

175
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,840
and create your first project.

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,850
We've also created
some challenges for you

177
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,740
that help solidify some of the
most important concepts of iOS

178
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,174
development that you'll need
to know to build any iOS app.

179
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,590
So after you
complete those, we'll

180
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,800
see you in the next section.
