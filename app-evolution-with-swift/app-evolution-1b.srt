1
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:03,570
Now that we've got
a handle on how

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,180
to start working
with storyboards,

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,330
let's build the first
screen in our application--

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,430
the product screen.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,729
This screen is going to
display an image that's

6
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:16,020
going to have a label with
the name of the phone on top

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,560
of that, and there's going
to be an add to cart button.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,390
Let's jump back into
Xcode to set this up.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,100
Before we try to connect up a
Swift file to the storyboard,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
let's delete this default
scene that the project gave us

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,692
when we selected single
view application template.

12
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,400
We can delete this
view in the storyboard

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,380
by clicking the View Controller
Scene and then hitting Delete.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,060
And we can also delete the
autogenerated ViewController

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,090
dot Swift file by right clicking
on it and choosing Delete

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,615
and then selecting
move to trash.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,970
We can add a new view
controller to our storyboard

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,830
by dragging from the object
panel to the storyboard editor.

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,610
The object panel is
at the bottom right

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,440
corner of the
screen and contains

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,127
a list of all of the
objects and views

22
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:07,585
that you can place
in a storyboard.

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,190
View Controller is the
very first one in the list,

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,390
so we'll click and drag
that view controller object

25
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,640
onto the storyboard
editor, and we

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,670
can see that it creates
a new scene for us,

27
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,062
complete with a view.

28
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:23,520
There's another
option that we have

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
to check because we
created this from scratch,

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,740
and that's Is Initial
View Controller, which

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,700
you can find in the Attributes
panel of the Inspector.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,560
Checking this makes
this view the one

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,564
that opens up whenever
this app runs.

34
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,980
We'll also want to go into the
first page of the Inspector

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,540
panel, which opens up
the file inspector.

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,715
And in here we'll want
to disable Size Classes.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,320
We get a Warning that we have
to confirm before disabling.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,130
This is because a
fully completed app

39
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,240
that runs on both
iPhone and iPad

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,310
would be using Size Classes.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,130
But right now, it will be a lot
easier for us to learn together

42
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,380
without Size Classes
turned on because they

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,250
add a lot of complexity
to layout in an app.

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,040
We recommend
ignoring Size Classes

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,150
when you're first
learning iOS development

46
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,449
and picking them up later.

47
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:13,400
If we disable Size Classes,
now the storyboard scene

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,540
looks a lot more like the
dimensions of a normal iPhone.

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,500
We'll make one more
change here by going back

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,300
into the Inspector
panel, and we'll

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,280
set the simulated metric
size of this view controller

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,750
to 4.7 inches.

53
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,900
The default setting of
inferred was actually

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,770
displaying a view size
for the four inch iPhones,

55
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,200
not the 4.7 inch screen
that the iPhone 6S has.

56
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,590
Now let's jump back
into some slides

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,881
to see what we need to do next.

58
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,490
Now that our product
ViewController is set up,

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,550
we need to add a label, image,
and button to the main view.

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,980
Whenever we put views
inside of the main view,

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,345
we refer to them as subviews.

62
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,280
So let's jump back
into Xcode now

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,660
and add some of those subviews.

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,320
Let's start building
out this main view

65
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,090
by dragging a label
from the object panel.

66
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,650
We can either
search by scrolling

67
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,800
or just type in the
search bar at the bottom,

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,270
and it will update the list
to show us only the views that

69
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,450
match our search term.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,910
As we click and drag the
label onto the main view,

71
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,890
you'll notice some
dotted blue lines appear.

72
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,164
They appear on the very left and
very right edges of the view,

73
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,580
and they also
appear in the center

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,162
to help you try
to center objects.

75
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,495
We'll drop this label right
in the middle of the screen.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,390
We can set the text for
this label in the Attributes

77
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:48,670
Inspector, and here we'll type
1937 Desk Phone and hit Return.

78
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,000
When we do that, you can
see that our label text got

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,424
truncated down with three dots.

80
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,340
The reason this is
happening is that the width

81
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,720
of the label in the
storyboard is not big enough

82
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,590
to hold all of the text.

83
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,940
So since we know we want
this button to be centered,

84
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,830
we can just grab these anchors
on the sides of the label

85
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,620
and drag them all the way out
to the left and right edges.

86
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,950
Then, back in the
attributes inspector,

87
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,300
we can center the label text.

88
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,589
That font doesn't look
too exciting, either,

89
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,640
so we can change the font
properties by clicking

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,860
on the small T icon
next to the font name,

91
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,580
and instead of
using a system font

92
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,040
we can choose a custom font.

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,800
Here we'll use Damascus.

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,340
Set the style to bold and
up the size to 24 points,

95
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,020
and then hit done.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,594
As you can see, the very top
line of the text looks cut off.

97
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,260
So we can drag the
labels height to make

98
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,635
it a little bigger so everything
is able to be displayed.

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,640
Now let's add an image
to our main view.

100
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,570
The object that displays an
image is called an Image View.

101
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,130
We can search for Image
View in the object panel,

102
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,310
then we'll click and drag
it onto our main view.

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,490
Notice that I'm not specifically
placing it anywhere yet.

104
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,470
The reason for that is
we need to actually add

105
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,320
the image file to
our Xcode project

106
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,130
before we can put it
inside of an Image View.

107
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,080
Images in Xcode
projects are stored

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,410
in something called
an asset catalog,

109
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,290
and every project
by default gets

110
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,050
an Assets dot XCassets file.

111
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,220
If we click on that asset
catalog in the project

112
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,170
navigator, you can see there's
not much in here right now.

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,600
You can add assets
to the catalog

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,480
by clicking the Plus button that
appears in the second column

115
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
and choosing import from
the menu that pops up.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,840
We've created a folder called
Image Files on our desktop

117
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,350
that will contain
some of the images

118
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,740
we'll be using in this course.

119
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,380
You can see there's two
images currently in here,

120
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,730
so you can drag and
select both to import them

121
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,902
both at the same time.

122
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,985
Then hit Open and they'll
be added to the project.

123
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,150
The first is called
button dash add to cart,

124
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,760
and the second is called
phone dash full screen 3,

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,890
and that's the image
we'll use right now.

126
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,970
Now back in main dot
storyboard file, make sure

127
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,370
we've selected the Image View
from the storyboard scene

128
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,020
navigator, and then in
the Attributes panel

129
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,750
we can see the first
option for the image

130
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,722
view is a field called Image.

131
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,180
If we click on the
drop down, we'll

132
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,900
get a list of any images that
are in our asset catalog.

133
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,750
So we'll pick the phone
full screen 3.

134
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,464
When we do that, it
doesn't quite look right.

135
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:50,630
The reason for this is that
the image view container

136
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,620
is one size, but the image we're
trying to display is another.

137
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,230
We can fix this by clicking
on the image in the Image

138
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,850
View-- you'll know that it's
selected because everything

139
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,900
around it gets grayed out-- and
then going to the editor menu

140
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,990
and choosing Size
to Fit Content.

141
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,400
This updates the
image view to be

142
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,110
the exact size of the image
displayed inside of it.

143
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,296
We can click on the Image View
object again so it's selected,

144
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,170
and then we can click
and drag the Image View

145
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,900
so that it fits perfectly
inside of our main view.

146
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,480
There's one other
little problem,

147
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,810
though-- our label
just disappeared.

148
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,330
This is because we put the
image view on top of the label

149
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,710
so it's completely obscuring it.

150
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,670
To fix this, just
rearrange the position

151
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,777
of the label and Image View in
the storyboard scene navigator.

152
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,610
Click and hold the Image
View and move it up

153
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,830
one spot so that the label
object is below the Image View

154
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,330
object.

155
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,890
And now the label
appears on top.

156
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,840
Finally, let's add a
button to this interface.

157
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,720
Since we already have
the storyboard open,

158
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,950
we can just search for
button in the object panel.

159
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,780
We want the first button
that comes up in the list,

160
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,630
and we'll click and drag it to
the center of the main view.

161
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,740
We could just put some
text for this button,

162
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,350
but our designers have created
a custom button image that

163
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,620
fits the theme really well.

164
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,590
Over in the
Attributes Inspector,

165
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,180
we can choose the default
image for the button

166
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,920
and pick button add
to cart from the list.

167
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,270
When we do this, you can see
that the original default

168
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,630
text for the button is
sitting on the right.

169
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,640
So again, in the
attribute panel,

170
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,940
we can highlight
that default text,

171
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,610
hit delete, and hit Enter.

172
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,830
Now we've got a
sharp looking button.

173
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,200
Let's build and run our app
to see what this looks like.

174
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,010
And there you have it.

175
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,850
Our very first product
screen laid out

176
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,277
in a storyboard
that's displaying

177
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:56,235
great in the simulator.

178
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,720
Now it's your turn to
create some subviews

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,212
and take some challenges.

180
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:03,670
Remember, if you're
following along

181
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,570
in your own copy
of Xcode, you can

182
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,710
download all of the image
assets that we showed you

183
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,880
in this level.

184
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
Have fun.
