00:00:00,732 --> 00:00:03,360
[SINGING] Starting back
in the machine age,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,820
the telephone had
just taken the stage.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,060
No one predicted
its acceleration,

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,440
evolving all of
our communication.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,110
Today we build with storyboards.
 Use XCode projects

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,160
where they're stored.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,340
Controllers with scroll,
navigating tables, outlets,

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,410
actions, buttons, and labels.

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,450
To code a phone is a learned
gift with the App Evolution

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,955
with Swift.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,570
Welcome back to App
Evolution with Swift.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,979
Our product View Controller
is in a really good place,

13
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,520
so we're going to switch gears
and work on a different screen

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,650
for our Contact View.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,080
Now that Contact View is going
to contain more content that

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,040
can fit on the device.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,130
So we're going to add
a Scroll View that

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,330
allows for stretching beyond
the bottom of the device screen

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,560
and scrolling up and down.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,080
Scroll Views look a
lot like a normal view,

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,640
except for one thing.

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,510
If you have subviews
that are outside

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,780
of the visible
screen on the device,

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,430
you can scroll up and
down, left and right

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,740
or both, to see
all of the content.

26
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,360
Now the Scroll View is still
a subview of the main view,

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,520
but all of the rest of
the subviews on the screen

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,960
go inside of the Scroll View.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,710
So let's jump into Xcode and
create our Contact screen

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,860
in a Scroll View.

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,679
To get started creating
our Scroll View,

32
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:26,970
we're going to create a brand
new View Controller scene

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,310
called Contact View Controller.

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,857
We'll search for a view
controller in the object panel

35
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,940
and slide our storyboard
to the right a little bit

36
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,120
so we've got some
more empty room.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,470
Then we'll click and drag on
the View Controller Object

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,030
and place it on the
storyboard editor.

39
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,120
We've also got the
assistant editor still open,

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,980
so let's turn that off by
clicking on the first icon

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,143
to turn the standard
editor back on.

42
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:55,976
Now we've got a full
view of the storyboard.

43
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,080
Let's also go ahead and
create the Swift file

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,450
for this View Controller, too.

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,420
Click on the project folder.

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,560
Then right-click,
and choose New File.

47
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,990
Then Cocoa Touch Class
from the iOS source section

48
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,759
and click Next.

49
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,300
For the name of this
View Controller,

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,980
we'll call it the
ContactViewController.

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,480
Make sure it's a
UI View Controller

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,876
and the language is Swift.

53
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:33,990
And we'll save it in our
project folder like before.

54
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,120
And also like before, we'll
delete all that boilerplate

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,325
code, except for the
viewDidLoad function.

56
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,290
Back in the storyboard, we'll
click on the View Controller,

57
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,640
open up the Class page
of the Inspector panel,

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,960
and set the name to
Contact View Controller.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Now let's go back
into the object panel

60
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,844
and search for Scroll
View, and drag it

61
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:05,885
into the View Controller.

62
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,330
We'll make this view full
screen by grabbing the anchors

63
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,020
and adjusting the
width and height,

64
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,670
so that it takes
up the entire width

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,312
and height of the main view.

66
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:18,020
Now we are ready to
start loading content

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,390
into the Scroll View.

68
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,300
First, let's head over
to the Asset Catalog

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,090
and add some new images that
we'll use on this screen.

70
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,430
In the Asset Catalog,
we click the plus button

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,430
at the bottom of the
panel, choose Import,

72
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,780
and on our desktop in
our Image Files folder,

73
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,980
we've added a few more images.

74
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,500
One for the header
and three icons

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,220
we can use in the
Contacts section.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,220
Back in our storyboard,
let's look for an Image View

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,363
in the Object Panel.

78
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,480
And we'll drag that
inside of the Scroll View.

79
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,420
Set the image for that image
view in the Attributes panel,

80
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,330
choosing the Image
Header Contact.

81
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,180
Then we click inside
of the Image View

82
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,560
so the image is selected.

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,239
And choose Editor,
Size to Fit Content.

84
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,269
Click out of the image.

85
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,480
And click and drag the
Image View into place

86
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,636
at the top of the screen.

87
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,820
Now let's grab a label and
drag it onto the Scroll View

88
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,540
and expand the
width to both edges.

89
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,710
We'll center the text, change
the font from System to Custom.

90
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:58,056
And, use Damascus again. Setting
the style to Bold and the size

91
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:58,555
to 24.

92
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,164
We'll also set the text to
About Us in all capital letters.

93
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,080
And then we'll adjust
the height of the label,

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,620
so we can see all of the text.

95
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
Now let's drag in another label.

96
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,519
But this label, we're not
going to make full width.

97
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,435
We're going to leave
some space on both sides.

98
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,110
And we'll set the alignment
to Justify instead of Center.

99
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,980
Our copywriter has
given us some text

100
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,240
that we can input into our
app for the About Us page.

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,180
So let's grab the
first line and copy it

102
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,160
with command-Z,
and back in Xcode,

103
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,791
paste it with command-V into
the Labels Text Attribute.

104
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:48,920
You can see that
the storyboard is

105
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,870
trying to fit all of
that text onto one line.

106
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,390
Even if we increase the
height of that label box,

107
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,330
it's still going to
fit all on one line.

108
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,080
Strangely enough, the way
you support multiple lines

109
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,996
on the label is to set
the number of lines to 0.

110
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,460
If we flip the number
of lines from 1 to 0,

111
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,472
now all of the text fits
across multiple lines.

112
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,430
We can tighten up the
label's width and height,

113
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,740
so it's not using any
more space than is needed.

114
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,117
For this font, instead
of using the System font,

115
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:22,200
we'll change it to Custom.

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,430
Use Georgia with the
regular style for the family

117
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,490
and will drop it
down to 16 points.

118
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,060
And, readjust the anchors
so the text fits nicely.

119
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,130
Rather than create
a brand new label

120
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,477
for the next block of
text, let's just duplicate

121
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:42,310
the one we have, since
all of the attributes

122
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,150
will be the same.

123
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,029
We can click on the
label and hit command-d.

124
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,070
And that will create a
duplicate that we can just

125
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,416
move below the first label.

126
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,040
You can see that the
storyboard is even

127
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,700
drawing some of those blue
anchor lines on the screen

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,820
to show how
everything is aligned.

129
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,750
We'll go back over to
our copywriter text,

130
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,760
copy the second line with
command-C, go back into Xcode,

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
select the text in
the Attributes panel.

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,370
Hit command-V to paste it
in, and then hit Return.

133
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,830
For the last label,
we'll do the same thing.

134
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,720
Click on the label.

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,140
Hit command-D. Line
it up into place.

136
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,040
Go back into the About Us copy.

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Select the text.

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,950
Hit command-C to copy.

139
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,670
Back into Xcode,
highlight the label text.

140
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,820
Hit command-V to paste.

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,980
And hit Return.

142
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,760
Since this text
is only one line,

143
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,100
we can bump the number
of lines back up to one.

144
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,760
We'll also change
the font properties

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,575
from Regular to Italic and
drop the size down to 14.

146
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,060
Then, we'll scroll the
storyboard down a bit

147
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,850
and drag the bottom
label anchor up,

148
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,671
so it's not taking
up too much space.

149
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,850
Now, let's duplicate
the About Us header

150
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,940
and drag it down here.

151
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,850
And change the text to
say Contact in full caps.

152
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,400
If we want to add some icons
to this Contact section,

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,190
we can start by searching
for an Image View Object,

154
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,590
and drag it onto
the Scroll View.

155
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,634
We'll set the image for that
Image View to icon-about-email.

156
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,659
We'll select the image
like we've done before,

157
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,878
and choose Editor,
Size to Fit Content.

158
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,410
Then, we click out of the
image, so we can pick it up

159
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,542
and drag it into place.

160
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:03,770
We can drag another
label in, setting it

161
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,507
to a custom font using Georgia.

162
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,590
Drop the text size down to 13.

163
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,160
And for the text, we'll
write, goodasold@example.com.

164
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:27,280
We can stretch out the email
address label so it all fits.

165
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,620
And now we have a
little bit of a problem.

166
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,850
We want to be able to add two
more images and two more labels

167
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,400
for the phone number and
website for our store,

168
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,190
but we don't have any more
room in our Scroll View.

169
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,450
We've reached the
very bottom of it.

170
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,660
We could try to make
the Scroll View taller,

171
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,556
but the main view isn't
going to get taller,

172
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,430
so we still wouldn't be
able to drag and drop

173
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,580
more stuff in the storyboard.

174
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,691
One way to fix this
is a little weird.

175
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,940
We can take the Scroll View
object, which is currently

176
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,950
a subview of the main view.

177
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,310
And we can click and drag it
out of the View Controller

178
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,270
hierarchy and down
below, so that it's still

179
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,640
part of the Contact
View Controller scene,

180
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,620
but it's not part of the Contact
View Controller main view.

181
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,060
As you can see, the
Contact View Controller

182
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,680
is still in the
storyboard editor.

183
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,790
But up above, there's a new
associated view that looks just

184
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,700
like our Scroll View.

185
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,840
We can't even pick this
up and move it around.

186
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,390
It's sort of locked into
place above the Contact View

187
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,510
Controller.

188
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,450
What that enables us to do,
is click on the Scroll View,

189
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,270
and go into the Inspector
Panel's fifth page, which

190
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,230
is the Size Inspector.

191
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,380
Let's scroll down to the bottom,
so we can see this changing.

192
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,930
As we click on
the Height button,

193
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,820
we can see the height
getting bigger and bigger.

194
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,080
If we hold the button
down, we keep increasing

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
the height of the Scroll View.

196
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,868
Or, we can just key in
the value that we want.

197
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,230
It seems like 800 is going
to give us enough space

198
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,440
to put all of our content.

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,090
Now, we'll go duplicate the
icon in the Contact section

200
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,695
three times.

201
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,065
And, duplicate the
label three times.

202
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,510
And then change the images
for the two new icons

203
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:25,470
back in the Attributes panel
to icon-about-phone and icon-

204
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,160
about-website.

205
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:36,590
We'll also change our label
text for both the phone number

206
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,340
and website.

207
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,340
And, we can even
select and move all

208
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,850
of those labels and images
that looks a little more center

209
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,484
than before.

210
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,560
Now, we need to do is, still
with our Scroll View selected,

211
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,650
go back into the Size
Inspector and change it

212
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,620
to what it was before.

213
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,970
The main view height for
an iPhone 6S is 667 points.

214
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,050
So we can enter that, and now it
looks like our content is gone,

215
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,700
but it's not.

216
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,890
It's just sort of
hiding below the scroll.

217
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
Next, we can create
a Scroll View Outlet

218
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,930
to the Contact View Controller.

219
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,360
So we'll select our Contact
View Controller object.

220
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,580
Turn the Assistant
Editor back on.

221
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,250
And then control-click and
drag from the Scroll View,

222
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,544
down to the Contact View
Controller code and let go.

223
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:40,960
We'll call this
outlet scrollView.

224
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,030
It we'll actually change the
storage from Strong to Weak.

225
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,540
Every time we have
a subview that's

226
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,590
going to be attached to
a controller's main view,

227
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,900
we can mark that
subview as weak.

228
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,110
Then we hit Connect.

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,170
And now we have an outlet
to our Scroll View,

230
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,290
that's in our Contact
View Controller scene.

231
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,510
One last step.

232
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,230
We'll click on the Contact View
Controller in the storyboard,

233
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,370
and click Is Initial
View Controller,

234
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,170
so that this view is
the one that displays

235
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,519
when we build and run the app.

236
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,560
Now, let's see how we can
connect the Scroll View

237
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,310
to the Contact View Controller
with code back in the slides.

238
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,870
Our Scroll View and subviews
all set up properly.

239
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,520
But we've got another problem.

240
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,890
Our Scroll View isn't showing
up when we build and run

241
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,200
our app, because the
Scroll View is not

242
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,920
a subview of the main view.

243
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,850
Since we have an outlet to the
Scroll View in the storyboard,

244
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,020
we can fix that pretty easily
by typing, view dot add subview

245
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,090
and passing it that
Scroll View variable

246
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,090
between the parentheses.

247
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,282
This attaches the Scroll View
to the main view hierarchy.

248
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:48,740
And thus the Scroll View, and
everything else that's in it,

249
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,490
can now be seen.

250
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,780
And there it is.

251
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,200
But wait, we're
still not scrolling.

252
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,260
Well, that's because we've
set the Scroll View's frame,

253
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,210
but not the content size.

254
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,390
So the Scroll View doesn't
know how much content

255
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,930
it should try to display.

256
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,820
We need to explicitly tell
the Scroll View how wide

257
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,680
and how high the content
is that's inside of it.

258
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,880
The place to do this is
in another View Controller

259
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,300
function that runs
after viewDidload,

260
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,900
called viewWillLayoutSubviews.

261
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,670
Any time you're changing the
size of a subview with code,

262
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,130
you should do it
in this function.

263
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,630
Inside of that function, we'll
set the Scroll View's content

264
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,350
size equal to the output of
a function called CG size.

265
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,440
CG size takes two values
as parameters, a width

266
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,400
and a height.

267
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,260
And here, we'll use
the values 375 for the width

268
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,240
and 800 for the
height, since those

269
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,990
are the values we used
for the Scroll View

270
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,130
in the storyboarding when we
were originally laying out

271
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,630
content.

272
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:49,850
And now you can see, we've
got a working Scroll View

273
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,990
that displays all of
our content and allows

274
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,240
us to scroll up and
down to see things that

275
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,670
don't fit on the device screen.

276
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,259
Now it's time for you to create
a Scroll View in your project

277
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,300
and take some challenges.

278
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,620
And I'll see you
in the next level.

279
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,464
.
