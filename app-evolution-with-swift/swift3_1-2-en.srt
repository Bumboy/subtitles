1
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:03,580
Now that we've got
a handle on how

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,220
to start working
with storyboards,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,870
let's build the first screen
in our application: the product

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,370
screen.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,541
This screen is going
to display an image.

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,040
It's going to have a label with
the name of the phone on top

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,930
of that.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,570
And there's going to be
an Add to Cart button.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,410
Let's jump back into
Xcode to set this up.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,110
Before we try to connect up a
swift file to the storyboard,

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,820
let's delete this default
scene that the project gave us

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,700
when we selected Single
View Application Template.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,420
We can delete this
view in the storyboard

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,370
by clicking the View controller
scene and then hitting Delete.

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,400
And we can also delete
the auto generated

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,377
view controller dot swift
file by right-clicking on it

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,210
and choosing Delete.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,828
And then selecting
Move to Trash.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,990
We can add a new view
controller to our storyboard

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,830
by dragging from the Object
panel to the Storyboard Editor.

21
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,630
The Object panel is
at the bottom right

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,470
corner of the
screen and contains

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,492
a list of all the objects
and views that you

24
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:07,575
can place in a storyboard.

25
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,180
View Controller is the
very first one in the list.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,390
So we'll click and drag
that View Controller object

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,410
onto the Storyboard Editor.

28
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,680
And we can see that it
creates a new scene for us

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,092
complete with a view.

30
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,550
There's another
option that we have

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,040
to check because we
created this from scratch.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,560
And that's Is Initial
View Controller,

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,060
which you can find
in the Attributes

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,690
panel of the Inspector.

35
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,580
Checking this makes
this view the one

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,375
that opens up whenever
this app runs.

37
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,870
Since the app we're going
to make in this course

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,280
will be built for
the iPhone 6s, we'll

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,280
also want to make sure
we're viewing as iPhone 6s

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,060
in this Trait Selection bar at
the bottom of the Scene Editor.

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,810
Ours is already set
to iPhone 6s here,

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,610
but you can see the
view change size

43
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,990
based on the device selected.

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,490
Now let's jump back
into some slides

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,210
to see what we need to do next.

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,330
Now that our Product View
Controller is set up,

47
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,410
we need to add a label, image,
and button to the Main view.

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,880
Whenever we put views
inside of the Main view,

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,230
we refer to them as subviews.

50
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,180
So let's jump back
into Xcode now

51
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,530
and add some of those subviews.

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,220
Let's start building
out this Main view

53
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,960
by dragging a label
from the Object panel.

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,530
We can either
search by scrolling

55
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,700
or just type in the
Search bar at the bottom,

56
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,160
and it will update the list
to show us only the views that

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,290
match our search term.

58
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,790
As we click and drag the
label onto the Main view,

59
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,760
you'll notice some
dotted blue lines appear.

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,054
They appear on the very left and
very right edges of the view.

61
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,470
And they also
appear in the center

62
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,090
to help you try to
center objects.

63
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,080
We'll drop this label right
in the middle of the screen.

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,290
We can set the text for
this label in the Attributes

65
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,020
Inspector.

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,572
And here we'll type "1937
desk phone" and hit Return.

67
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,880
When we do that, you can
see that our label text got

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,314
truncated down with three dots.

69
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:14,230
The reason this is
happening is that the width

70
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,620
of the label in the
storyboard is not big enough

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,490
to hold all of the text.

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,790
So since we know we want
this button to be centered,

73
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,720
we can just grab these anchors
on the sides of the label

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,540
and drag them all the way out
to the left and right edges.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,860
Then back in the
Attributes Inspector,

76
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,190
we can center the label text.

77
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,460
That font doesn't look
too exciting either.

78
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,020
So we can change
the font properties

79
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,710
by clicking on the small T
icon next to the font name.

80
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,440
And instead of
using a system font,

81
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,870
we can choose a custom font.

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,620
Here, we'll use Damascus.

83
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,260
Set the style to bold.

84
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,245
And up the size to 24 points.

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,920
And then hit Done.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,504
As you can see, the very top
line of the text looks cut off.

87
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:11,170
So we can drag the
labels height to make

88
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,544
it a little bigger so everything
is able to be displayed.

89
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,709
Now let's add an image
to our Main view.

90
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,450
The object that displays an
image is called an image view.

91
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,030
We can search for image
view in the Object panel.

92
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,394
Then we'll click and drag
it onto our Main view.

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,350
Notice that I'm not specifically
placing it anywhere yet.

94
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,370
The reason for that is
we need to actually add

95
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,200
the image file to
our Xcode project

96
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,020
before we can put it
inside of an image view.

97
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,410
Images in Xcode projects
are stored in something

98
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,260
called Asset Catalog.

99
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,190
And every project
by default gets

100
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,920
an assets dot xc assets file.

101
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,120
If we click on that asset
catalog in the Project

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,121
Navigator, you can see there's
not much in here right now.

103
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,510
You can add assets
to the catalog

104
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,370
by clicking the plus button that
appears in the second column

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,780
and choosing Import from
the menu that pops up.

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,850
We've created a folder called
Image files on our desktop that

107
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,600
will contain some of the images
we'll be using in this course.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,280
You can see there's two
images currently in here.

109
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,610
So you can drag and
select both to import them

110
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,810
both at the same time.

111
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,430
Then hit Open, and they'll
be added to the project.

112
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,020
The first is called
button dash add to cart.

113
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,650
And the second is called
phone dash full screen 3.

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,740
And that's the image
we'll use right now.

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,390
Now, back in the
main.storyboard file,

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,980
make sure we've
selected the Image

117
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,820
View from the storyboard
Scene Navigator.

118
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,932
And then in the
Attributes panel,

119
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:52,640
we can see the first
option for the image

120
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,620
view is a field called Image.

121
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,070
If we click on the
dropdown, we'll

122
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,760
get a list of any images that
are in our asset catalog.

123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,730
So we'll pick a
phone full screen 3.

124
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,334
When we do that it
doesn't quite look right.

125
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,500
The reason for this is that
the image view container

126
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,510
is one size, but the image we're
trying to display is another.

127
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,722
We can fix this by clicking on
the image in the Image view.

128
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:19,180
You'll know that it's selected
because everything around it

129
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,200
gets grayed out.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,810
And then going to
the Editor menu

131
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,860
and choosing Size
to Fit Content.

132
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,300
This updates the
image view to be

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,884
the exact size of the image
displayed inside of it.

134
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,550
We can click on the
image view object

135
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,180
again so it's selected.

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,070
And then we can click
and drag the Image view

137
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,750
so that it fits perfectly
inside of our Main view.

138
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,770
There's one other
little problem though.

139
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,700
Our label just disappeared.

140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,230
This is because we put the
image of you on top of the label

141
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,560
so it's completely obscuring it.

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
To fix this, just
rearrange the position

143
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,636
of the label and image view in
the Storyboard Scene Navigator.

144
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,510
Click and hold the image
view, and move it up

145
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,760
one spot so that the label
object is below the image view

146
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,740
object.

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,777
And now the label
appears on top.

148
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,740
Finally, let's add a
button to this interface.

149
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,590
Since we already have
the storyboard open,

150
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,830
we can just search for
button in the Object panel.

151
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,680
We want the first button
that comes up in the list.

152
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,510
And we'll click and drag it to
the center of the Main view.

153
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,600
We could just put some
text for this button.

154
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,200
But our designers have created
a custom button image that

155
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,480
fits the theme really well.

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,470
Over in the
Attributes Inspector,

157
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,060
we can choose the default
image for the button

158
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,800
and pick button-addtocart
from the list.

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,170
When we do this, you can see
that the original default

160
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,520
text for the button is
sitting on the right.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,530
So again, in the
Attribute panel,

162
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,800
we can highlight
that default text,

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,460
hit Delete, and hit Enter.

164
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,710
Now we've got a
sharp looking button.

165
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,290
Let's build and run our app
to see what this looks like.

166
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,750
And there you have it our very
first product screen laid out

167
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,220
in a storyboard
that's displaying

168
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,730
great in the simulator.

169
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,610
Now it's your turn to
create some subviews

170
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,102
and take some challenges.

171
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,560
Remember, if you're
following along

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,470
in your own copy
