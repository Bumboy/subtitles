1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
 

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,810
Welcome to App
Evolution with Swift.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,700
I'm Jon Friskics.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,283
And in this course,
you'll be learning

5
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:11,630
how to build your first
simple iOS app with Swift.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,040
Swift is a programming language
that Apple introduced in

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,250
June 2014 for creating
iOS and OS X apps.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,650
Apple has been updating
Swift pretty regularly

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,660
with new features and fixes.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,660
And as of the recording
of this course,

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,020
Swift is in version 2.1.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,354
You can still make
apps with Objective C.

13
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:33,770
But if you're just starting
to learn iOS development right

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,715
now, it probably makes sense
to learn with Swift first.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,730
In this course, the simple
app we're going to build

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,780
is for the fictional good as old
phone store-- an antique phone

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,150
shop that sells nothing
but old telephones.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,660
This app will have the ability
to view a list of old phones,

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,640
tap into that list to get
details about each phone,

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,690
and display a message when the
Add to Cart button is tapped.

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,490
We'll also have a
contact screen that

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,850
contains more content than
will fit on the device

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,280
that you need to
scroll through to read.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,310
As we make the different
parts of this app,

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,590
we're going to be showing
you short screencasts of how

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,690
to work in Xcode, which is the
program that you write apps in.

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,860
So feel free to pause the video
and head over to the Mac App

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,490
Store to download Xcode
so you can follow along

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,720
on your own computer.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,349
Xcode does only run on the Mac.

31
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:27,390
So if you're following
along with all of the code

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,550
that we're writing, you
will need a Mac in order

33
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,490
to be able to build an app.

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,960
If you're using a PC
or other computer,

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,076
you can still watch the videos
to see how all this works.

36
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:40,700
[SINGING] Starting back
in the machine age,

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
the telephone had
just taken the stage.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,420
No one predicted
its acceleration,

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,780
evolving all of
our communication.

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,150
Today, we build
with storyboards,

41
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,520
use Xcode projects
where they're stored,

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,690
controllers with scroll,
navigating tables, outlets,

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,420
actions, buttons, and labels.

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,780
To code a phone is a learned
gift with the app evolution

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,320
with Swift.

46
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,919
Before we start
making an app, there's

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,470
a very important
prerequisite that we

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,790
need-- to understand
how to make a sandwich.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,140
No, really, stay with me.

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,850
Making iOS apps is actually
a lot like making a sandwich.

51
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,650
You need a pile of ingredients
like bread, onions and cheese.

52
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,750
Maybe even some meat.

53
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,960
You also need a place to prepare
those ingredients-- different

54
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,890
utensils like a cutting board,
knives and forks, maybe even

55
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,230
a plastic bag to carry it
with you after it's made.

56
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,214
And not every
sandwich is the same.

57
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,630
But unless you can tell the
chef how to make it different,

58
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,220
you won't get the
sandwich you want.

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,190
In this analogy, UIKit is like
the parts of the sandwich.

60
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,170
It's a framework that contains
templates for standardized ways

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,880
to display data in your app,
like text, images, and buttons.

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,660
Xcode is like the
kitchen and utensils.

63
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,950
It contains all of the
tools you need to assemble

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,810
the parts of the sandwich.

65
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,060
It's a free program that's
provided by Apple that they

66
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,450
update a few times each year.

67
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,480
And Swift is the instructions
for making the sandwich.

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,890
You'll write Swift code and
Xcode that tells parts of UIKit

69
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,170
how to display your data.

70
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,860
And the chef-- well, that's you.

71
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,430
So let's get started
by seeing how we

72
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,230
can create a project in Xcode.

73
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,720
After you've
downloaded Xcode, you

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,810
can open it by double-clicking
on the Xcode app alias,

75
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,490
or by finding it in your
applications folder.

76
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,140
In the splash
screen that pops up,

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,667
there's an option for
creating a new Xcode project.

78
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,000
The first thing you're asked
is to choose a new template

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,420
for your project.

80
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,820
Templates contain some common
starting configurations

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,419
for different kinds of apps.

82
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,960
For the app we're
making today, we're

83
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,270
going to choose Single
View Application

84
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,010
because that's the closest
one to a bare bones default

85
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,510
template.

86
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,220
And it will be a good
place for us to start.

87
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,230
Once we click Next,
we're shown a screen

88
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,381
where we can set some
options for our project.

89
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,380
This is where we want to
set the name of our app

90
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,920
for the product name.

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,020
Here, we'll type
"good as old phones."

92
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,420
You want to set the organization
name, which is usually

93
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,790
just your company name, and then
the organization identifier,

94
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,459
which is usually in the form
of com dot company name.

95
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,920
That automatically generates
a bundle identifier,

96
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,989
which is what identifies your
app as unique in the store.

97
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,530
We'll make sure we've got Swift
selected in the language drop

98
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,490
down.

99
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,562
And for the device,
we'll choose iPhone.

100
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,270
That's because the
app we're making today

101
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,820
is only going to
be built to be run

102
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,870
on the iPhone, not an universal
app that runs on iPhone

103
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,650
or iPad.

104
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,670
We'll also leave these
three boxes unchecked

105
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,830
because we won't need any of
these features in our app.

106
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,720
Once we click Next,
we're asked where we

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,192
want to save this new project.

108
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,650
Here, we'll save
it on the desktop.

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,350
After hitting Create, we can see
that Xcode opens up like this.

110
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,910
It might look kind
of intimidating,

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,400
but the screen we
see here is just

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,957
showing some general
options for our application.

113
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:07,040
We don't even need to
change any of these settings

114
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,850
to get started.

115
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,780
On the left, you'll see a panel
with eight icons on the top.

116
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,920
And that first icon contains
the Project Navigator.

117
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,790
This is where all the files in
your project will be displayed.

118
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,680
And you could open up
any one of those files

119
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
by single-clicking
on the file name.

120
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,060
Right now, we'll open
up Main.storyboard.

121
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,770
And let's jump back
into some slides

122
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,850
real quick to talk about
what a storyboard is.

123
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,800
A storyboard is a way
to visually lay out

124
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,380
the screens in your
application as scenes

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,860
and create templates for
different UI elements

126
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,120
that can later be filled
in with real data.

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,190
You can also connect
different scenes together

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,940
and model how the user will
flow between them as they

129
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,040
interact with your app.

130
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,080
Each scene contain something
called a view controller that

131
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,380
manages one main view.

132
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,900
And everything else that
you see on the screen

133
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,670
goes inside of that main view.

134
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's jump back into Xcode to
play around with the main view

135
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,540
and see if we can change
some of its properties.

136
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,620
To access the main view
for this storyboard,

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,630
we need to look in the
storyboard Scene Editor panel.

138
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,475
If this panel isn't
showing up for you,

139
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,120
you can click on this icon at
the bottom left of the Editor

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,332
panel to expand and collapse it.

141
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:22,790
Then we can just
click on the arrow

142
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,789
to expand the View
Controller Scene,

143
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,330
and then click on
the View Controller

144
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,800
to expand the view and
layout guides inside of it.

145
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,840
The panel on the right is
called the Inspector panel.

146
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,970
If you don't see it
in your copy of Xcode,

147
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,520
you can click on this far
right icon in the toolbar

148
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,890
to make it appear and disappear.

149
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,060
The Inspector panel
contains six different ways

150
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,462
you can inspect the
parts of your storyboard.

151
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,670
Right now, we'll click on
the fourth inspector, which

152
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,391
is the attributes inspector.

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,765
And there's an attribute for
this view called Background.

154
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,050
If we click on the color
here and pick a new color

155
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,980
from the color
picker that comes up,

156
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,341
we can see that our view
changes color in the storyboard.

157
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,840
We can run this app
right now to see

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,120
what it looks like on this
computer using an iPhone

159
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,862
simulator.

160
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,320
You can choose what
device you want

161
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,830
to simulate from this
drop-down in the toolbar.

162
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,440
Here, you can see we have
devices ranging from the iPad 2

163
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,070
all the way up to
the iPhone 6s Plus.

164
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,060
We'll choose iPhone
6s because that's

165
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,600
the size we'll be designing for.

166
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,830
Then, you can just hit the
Play button in the toolbar

167
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,540
and it will build and
run the application

168
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,665
and show you the simulator.

169
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,220
And here you can see the result
of setting the main view's

170
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,295
background color to
red in the storyboard.

171
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,020
If you haven't been
following along already,

172
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,990
now is a great time
to jump into Xcode

173
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,880
and create your first project.

174
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,890
We've also created
some challenges for you

175
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,760
to help solidify some of the
most important concepts of iOS

176
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,194
development that you'll need
to know to build any iOS app.

177
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,610
So after you
complete those, we'll

178
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,820
see you in the next section.
