1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,170
Je suis Drew Barontini.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,520
Ceci est la Formation Front-End,
Level One:

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,610
Vue d'ensemble et mises à jour.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,680
Dans ce niveau, nous allons
donner un bref aperçu de

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,920
HTML5, nous allons donner un
aperçu de CSS3, parler de quelques-uns

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,660
des éléments HTML mises à jour en
HTML5, puis parler des

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,130
mises à jour de certaines balises HTML existantes en HTML5.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,540
Maintenant, nous allons commencer par
donner un aperçu de HTML5.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,300
HTML5 est seulement une
définition utilisée pour se référer à

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,880
la dernière version de HTML -
la dernière norme.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,340
Et il comprend plusieurs nouvelles
fonctionnalités, telles que les nouveaux

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,900
éléments et attributs HTML, le
support complet de CSS3, vidéo et audio,

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,210
les éléments graphiques 2D et 3D,
le stockage local,

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,510
et une base de données SQL locale.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,340
Or, dans ce cours, nous allons juste
mettre l'accent sur les nouveaux

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,600
éléments et attributs HTML, ainsi
que la prise en charge complète de CSS3.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,260
Maintenant que nous avons donné un
aperçu de HTML5, nous allons donner

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,700
un bref aperçu de CSS3.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,770
Comme le HTML5, CSS3 est seulement
utilisé comme une définition pour

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,090
the latest standard of CSS.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,010
And there are several new
features in CSS3, and we'll

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,560
cover several of those here,
such as border radius, box

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,020
shadow and text shadow,
transitions and transforms,

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,620
gradients, multiple backgrounds,
and font face.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,080
Now text shadow and font face
will actually predate CSS3,

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,100
but they're still important
components to modern CSS.

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,970
So we're going to cover
them in this course.

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,570
So now that we've given a brief
overview CSS3, let's

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,250
move on to talk about
some of the updated

30
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,060
HTML elements in HTML5.

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,310
And those elements include,
the doctype, the meta

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,230
declaration, the script
tag, and the link tag.

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,480
So let's start by talking
about the doctype.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,120
Now in HTML 4.01, there
were a few doctypes.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,770
We had the strict doctype, the
transitional doctype, and

36
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,280
frameset doctype.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,810
Now these are really difficult
to remember, and you were used

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,870
to just copying and pasting them
from project to project.

39
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,850
In HTML5, though, we have
one simple doctype and

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,180
it looks like this.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,240
Now a quick convention note
here, when you see this HTML5

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,150
logo on top of a code block,
it signifies that the code

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,500
being shown is the
updated HTML5

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,400
version, like it is here.

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,530
The next HTML5 element that's
been updated is the meta

46
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,680
declaration.

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,330
Now in HTML4, it looked
something like this.

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,670
You recognize this because it's
the tag you put inside

49
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,470
the head of your document to
specify the character encoding

50
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,250
for your HTML document.

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,980
Now this is, again, long, like
those doctypes in HTML4, so

52
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,950
it's something that we were
copying and pasting from

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,150
project to project.

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,630
But in HTML5 it's
really simple.

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,220
You just need to specify the
charset attribute, and in this

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,820
case, our character
encoding is UTF-8.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,520
The next HTML tag that receives
an update in HTML5 is

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
the script tag,

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,950
and this is what you use to
reference external JavaScript

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,200
files, or write inline
JavaScript.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,610
Now in HTML4, you need to
specify the type attribute to

62
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,300
be text/JavaScript.

63
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,510
And in HTML5, we don't need this
type attribute, because

64
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,080
the browser will infer that
JavaScript is the type.

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,760
In HTML 4.01, the link tag
required the type attribute to

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,560
be text/CSS.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,860
In HTML5, though, we don't
need this type

68
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,950
attribute at all.

69
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,610
The browser will infer
that CSS is the type

70
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,860
for the link tag.

71
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,480
So now that we've talked about
some of the updated HTML

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,880
elements in HTML5, let's wrap up
this level by talking about

73
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,063
the updates to the existing
HTML elements in HTML5.

74
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,540
The i, and b, and em, and strong
tags were traditionally

75
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,640
considered presentational
tags.

76
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,550
But in HTML5, they've been given
new semantic meanings.

77
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,520
The i and b tags were considered
font style

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,150
decorations in HTML4.

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,900
The i tag rendered text in a
italic font style, while the b

80
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,660
tag rendered text in
a bold font style.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,950
In HTML5, though, these tags
have new meanings.

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,100
The i tag now represents text
that is in an alternate voice

83
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,790
or mood, and the b tag
represents text that is

84
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,040
stylistically offset.

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,529
So now let's look at some
example uses for the i tag.

86
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,220
We have things like a taxonomic
designation, a

87
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,055
technical term, an idiomatic
phrase from another language,

88
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,410
a transliteration, a thought, a
ship name in Western texts.

89
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,850
Now these are real technical
terms that the spec gives us,

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,850
so let's look at a more
practical example

91
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,590
of using the i tag.

92
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,900
So here we have this paragraph
text, "I hope

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,040
this works," he thought.

94
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,080
We're wrapping "I hope this
works" in an i tag to

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,460
designate this text as being in
an alternate voice or mood.

96
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,710
It's considered a thought.

97
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,640
So now let's look at some
example uses for the b tag.

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,950
We have things like keywords in
a document, product names

99
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,320
in a review, actionable words
in interactive software, or

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,300
something like an
article lead.

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,940
Now these examples are a little
bit better than the

102
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,820
ones we were given for the i tag.

103
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,960
But again, let's look at a
more practical example of

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,120
using the b tag.

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,880
Here we have a paragraph, and
we're wrapping the text in a b

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,790
tag with a class of lead.

107
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,360
Now we're doing this, because
we want this text to be

108
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,500
stylistically offset from the
paragraphs that follow it,

109
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,670
because it's going to
be an article lead.

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,460
And in addition, we add a class
of lead to the b tag to

111
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,990
give it further semantic
meaning.

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,480
Next up, we have the
em and strong tags.

113
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,170
And in HTML4, the em tag meant
emphasis, while the strong tag

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,990
meant strong emphasis.

115
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,950
But in HTML5, they have
new meanings.

116
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,460
The em tag now mean stress
emphasis, while the strong tag

117
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,360
now means strong importance.

118
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,210
So let's look at some
examples of these.

119
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,710
So here we have a paragraph with
the text, "Make sure to

120
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,790
sign up before the day of the
event, September 16, 2013."

121
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,480
We're wrapping the word "before"
in an em tag in

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,800
order to give stress emphasis
to the word "before." it's a

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,210
linguistic change.

124
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,720
For the strong tag, in that same
sentence, we're wrapping

125
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,190
the date, September 16, 2013,
in a strong tag, in order to

126
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,860
give strong importance to
the date of the event.

127
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,270
With that, you now have a basic
introduction to the

128
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,110
changes in HTML5.

129
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,240
Let's see what you can do
with some challenges.

130
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,730
Let's look at some
"exsample" uses -

131
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,640
example.

132
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,960
Look at some "exsample" uses -

133
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,180
good lord!

134
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,160
Ex samples, they're
no longer samples.
