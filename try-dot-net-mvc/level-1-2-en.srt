1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:02,940
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,920
In this section, we're
going to learn about routes.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,800
Routes are how our application
uses the URL to determine what

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,370
controller and controller
action it wants to access.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,175
In our last section, the
action we were accessing

6
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,300
would have been Home/Index.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,520
How exactly do our routes
map up with our controllers

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,740
and actions?

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,230
When you look at our URL--
www.example.com/Home/index--

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,760
the first directory you'll
see typically maps up with

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,210
the controller.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,600
So in this case, Home would
map up to the Home Controller.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,730
While the second
part, Index, would

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,575
typically map up to the
action, in this case, Index.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,660
The controller also maps to
the views in the same manner.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,650
You'll notice our
home controller,

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,030
with its index action,
maps up to our home

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,940
directory in our Views
folder and our Index

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,020
view inside that directory.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,480
In this case,
returning View will

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,750
return the view in the Home
folder with the Index action.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,970
Normally, when we
go to a website,

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,600
we don't go to
whatever.com/Home/Index.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,746
We would just type
in whatever.com.

25
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:26,970
You'll notice, when
we access our website,

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,660
even if we don't enter
Home/Index, we still get there.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,530
This is because of a concept
known as default routes.

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,510
With default routes,
anytime you omit

29
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,470
the controller or the
action from the URL,

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,700
it's going to default a
controller and action.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,985
Normally, it will default
these to Home/index.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,250
Why don't you try identifying
some routes in the challenges,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,780
and I'll see you in
the next section.
