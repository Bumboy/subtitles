00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
[SINGING] The time has
come for a .NET quest,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,377
the MVC pattern
ensures your success.

3
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:06,210
Building with models,
views, and controllers

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,085
is better than jousting
with oversized ogres.

5
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:14,373
You'll be fetching data and
routing requests with C sharp carved

6
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:17,410
on your family crest.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:23,770
Rescue your web apps and let them be
free by writing and trying .NET

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,770
MVC.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,168
By writing and trying .NET MVC.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,170
Welcome back to Try .NET MVC.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,020
My name is Eric Fisher.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,785
In this level, we're going to
go over getting user input.

13
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:43,530
In the last level, we set up a
review to use data dynamically.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,740
Unfortunately, we
were still hard coding

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,400
that data in the controller.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,905
So we need to set
up our application

17
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,520
to be able to accept user input.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,640
To accomplish this,
we're going to need

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,570
to create a form in our view.

20
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,140
We're going to need
to add a Create method

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,430
to our controller.

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,660
And we'll need to move our
existing logic from our Index

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,915
action to our Create action.

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,690
We'll start by adding a basic
form to our Index.cshtml view,

25
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,820
as you can see here.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,730
When we add our
Create method, it's

27
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,290
going to look a lot
like our Index method.

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,460
The big difference here is we're
going to be accepting a string

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,416
parameter.

30
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,290
Now, you'll notice the
name of this parameter

31
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,970
is character name.

32
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,820
You'll also notice that
the input field on our form

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,940
is also named character name.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,710
Because the name
of our input field

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,240
and the name of our
parameter are the same,

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,420
these will automatically map up.

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,370
When we hit the submit
button, whatever

38
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,610
we enter into that text
box is automatically

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,368
going to be populated
into our parameter.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,459
So let's take that
Create method and move it

41
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,500
into our home controller.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,380
We'll put it right
after our Index method.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,220
Now currently, our Index method
is creating our character,

44
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,650
setting its fields.

45
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,780
And that's really the
purpose of our Create method.

46
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,238
So we're going to go ahead and
take the code from our Index

47
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:14,170
method and move it down
to our Create method.

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,350
And then we'll set our
index back to just returning

49
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,241
a simple view.

50
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,580
We were hard coding our
character's name field,

51
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,426
but let's go ahead
and use that character

52
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,550
name we've been passing
into our parameter instead.

53
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,080
Before, we didn't have to
specify the name of the view

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,380
because our actions' name
matched the name of the view

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,490
it was returning.

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,210
Instead, we're going to specify
the view in our Create method

57
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,550
by adding Index as the
first parameter for our view

58
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,750
we are returning.

59
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,750
This'll have the effect
of returning our index

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,920
view with the data when our
Create method is called.

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,650
The last thing we're going
to do is go to our view

62
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,480
and tell our form what
action we want to access.

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,790
We do this by using what's
called a tag helper.

64
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,220
In this case, we're
going to use asp-action,

65
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,050
and we're going to
set that to Create

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,210
to access our Create method.

67
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,480
Because our index view happens
to be in the home folder

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,960
and accessing the
home controller,

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,970
we wouldn't need to
specify what controller,

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,010
because the automatic
mapping would help.

71
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,780
But in the event I needed to
reach into a controller that

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,640
didn't automatically
have that mapping,

73
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,770
I could use
asp-controller, and then

74
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,185
specify the controller
I want to access.

75
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,470
At this point, our view is
now able to accept user input

76
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,540
and render that input
in the list below.

77
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,700
Now it's your turn to
create a view that accepts

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,115
user input in the challenges.

79
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,390
Have fun.

80
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,665
The structure of an ASP.NET
MVC project-- ah, that's

81
00:03:57,665 --> 00:03:58,790
a terrible way to start it.

82
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,017
[INAUDIBLE]

83
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:04,450
You could pick it up from--
