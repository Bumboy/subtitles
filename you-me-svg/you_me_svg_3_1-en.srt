1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,190
[SINGING] With a viewbox or port
you have nothing to lose.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,210
Draw yourself in any shape
or vector you choose.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,900
From circles to rects,
polygons to ellipses,

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,400
groups will connect, then
transform and rotate these.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,065
Soon you'll see
where you can be,

6
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,665
creating scalable
graphics with glee.

7
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:20,140
Just you, me, and SVG.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,970
You're watching
"You, Me, and SVG."

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,980
This is level three, where
we will be covering groups.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,710
As a little refresher,
here's where

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,410
we left off with our badge
in the index.html file.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,130
Our badge is still looking
a little plain, however, so

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,270
how could we add some more
detail or pizzazz to our badge,

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,920
with perhaps some groups
of triangles here or there?

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,590
How could we do this?

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,940
We'd start off by
drawing and positioning

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,590
three of the triangles.

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,600
We'd give them points so
that we'd have one on top

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,030
and two on bottom.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,020
We'd give them the fill
of the greenish blue color

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,690
and a stroke of one pixel.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,910
If we go ahead of the polygon
is inside of our index.html

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,370
and open up our
browser, we'll see

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,180
that we do have the
group of three triangles,

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,230
but it's not a
part of the badge.

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,690
So how are we going to move
this over and down so that it's

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,015
a part of our beautiful badge.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,110
We could add 45 pixels
to each x element and 67

29
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,950
to each y in order to
get all of the triangles

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,950
to move over and down and
be a part of the badge.

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,830
This is getting a bit
tedious, and there

32
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,490
has to be a better way though.

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,250
Well, this is where
groups come to the rescue.

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,680
We can add a g tag, or
group, around the polygons.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,620
And by doing so, we
can now transform them.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,380
We can move them over
and down as a whole.

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,800
We'll use a transform
attribute inside the g tag.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,110
This will allow us to do
things like translate,

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,970
or scale and rotate, to
the group as a whole.

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,070
So inside the g tag, we'll
say transform, translate,

41
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,570
and we'll give it
the 45, 67, that it

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,020
needs to move for its x and y.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,875
Remember, translate is
kind of a weird word.

44
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,190
So if you're ever wondering,
what was translate again?

45
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,810
It's just to move.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,710
Translate to move.

47
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,080
We'll load the badge
back up in the browser.

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,056
And we'll see now that
the group of polygons

49
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,210
is inside the badge,
as we expected.

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,540
Effectively, by
grouping these polygons,

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,200
we've given them a new
0,0, a new origin point.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,690
And then when we
transform translate,

53
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,490
we're moving that origin
point over by 45 and 67.

54
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,410
For the next group
of triangles we

55
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,960
can simply copy paste
that group of polygons

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,520
that we used before.

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,490
We do need to change the
translation, however.

58
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,470
It needs to be 198 from the
left edge, and 67 from the top.

59
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,600
So we'll say, transform
translate 198, 67.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,420
If you load the badge
up, you'll see now

61
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,460
that we have those two
groups of triangles.

62
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,950
For a third one, we
do it all over again.

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,500
Copy paste that group,
and, this time, we'll

64
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,340
give it a translation
so that it's

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,890
at the bottom
center of the badge.

66
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,990
Notice that we said
121.5 for the x.

67
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,265
SVG coordinates
can use decimals.

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,480
A lot of these styles
are duplicated, however.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,970
And this is something that
group takes care of yet again.

70
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,960
We can give each group a
class of triangle group.

71
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,380
Then, inside our
style sheet, we'll

72
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,840
call out the class
of triangle group

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,320
and give each of these polygons
a stroke width of one pixel.

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,610
Remember before, when we
gave the blueish-green fill

75
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,160
to all polygons?

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,090
We actually don't
have to say that again

77
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,420
inside the triangle group.

78
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,000
They'll still
inherit that style.

79
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,530
Groups have allowed us to
translate, or to move, elements

80
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,620
as a whole on the page.

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,670
And they've also allowed
us to clean up our styles.

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,115
Groups are the best.

83
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,990
Why don't you go give them
a try in the challenges,

84
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,780
and I'll see you back
in the next section.
