1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,540
[SINGING] With a viewbox or port,
you have nothing to lose.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,210
Draw yourself in any shape
or vector you choose.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,460
From circles to rects,
polygons to ellipses.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,460
Groups will connect,

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,400
then transform and
rotate these.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,450
Soon you'll see
where you can be,

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,810
creating scalable
graphics with glee.

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,116
Just You, Me & SGV!

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,560
Welcome back.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,600
This is level two
in You, Me, and SGV.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,090
In this section,
we'll be covering

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,860
a new element, circles.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,030
In the last level, we
created our X59 retina screen

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,660
in icon form.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,150
So for the Schmuffle's
sake, let's

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,090
go ahead and build the Schmuffle
phone in icon form two.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,690
We'll start off by including
the phone in an image tag.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,060
Say image, source, phone,
underscore, icon.svg.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,100
We'll then open that file,
and inside our SVG tag

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,350
that has all of
those pre things,

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,055
of the XML namespace and the
version number, all of those

22
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:05,910
are already in there.

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,790
Inside that, we'll
create a rect tag.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,080
We'll give our rectangle
a height of 100

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,770
and a width of 70.

26
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,560
We'll also give it a fill of
white and a stroke of red.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,890
The red color is in
hexadecimal form,

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,250
whereas white is
using the keyword.

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,810
Both are accepted
inside these SVG tags.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,610
When we pull up
our browser, you'll

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,650
see that our white
rectangle does in fact,

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,600
now have a red stroke.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,240
It's kind of thin though.

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,370
We can adjust this by
saying stroke-width,

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,890
and give it a larger one, so 10.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,230
Now, when we refresh,
it's thicker.

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,850
But something is happening on
our top and left of our icon,

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,900
something weird.

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,630
What's happening here?

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,400
Well, first, I'm going to draw
a blue line around our viewport

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,870
so we can visualize it.

42
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,090
I'll put a dot at
0,0, the top left.

43
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,990
If we zoom in, we'll
see that our viewport

44
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,690
outline is centered along
the rectangle stroke.

45
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,950
And half of it is being
cut off, it's not seen.

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,710
This is easily adjusted by
just moving our icon away

47
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,530
from the viewport's edge.

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,629
We can give our rect an x
of five and a y of five.

49
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,170
And when we reload
it in the browser,

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,150
you'll see that our full 10
pixel stroke is surrounding

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,340
the white rectangle now.

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,150
So what do we have left?

53
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,970
Well, we need to
go ahead and round

54
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,640
those corners on the
rectangle and add

55
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,090
the circle in the bottom.

56
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,540
We'll start off by
drawing the circle.

57
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,320
Conveniently enough, this
is with a circle tag.

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,260
So below the rect,
we'll say circle.

59
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,420
And we need to give it a
center point for its x and y.

60
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,800
So we'll say cx
of 40, cy of 105.

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,120
So it's at the bottom and
middle of our phone icon.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,180
We also need to
give it a radius.

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,920
So r of three, so the circle
knows how large to be.

64
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,260
If we look in the browser, we'll
see that we have our circle.

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,430
It's the right size, and
it's in the right position,

66
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,790
but it's the wrong color.

67
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,080
We can change that,
simply, with a fill

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,470
of white inside the circle tag.

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,755
Now all we need are the rounded
corners for our phone icon

70
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:30,380
to be complete.

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,320
Before we can create
those rounded corners,

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,270
though, we need to
know about ellipses.

73
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,470
We can create an ellipse
with an ellipse tag.

74
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,550
We give it the same cx and
cy for the center points,

75
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,770
like we did with the circle.

76
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,100
However, unlike a
circle, an ellipse

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,780
has two different radiuses.

78
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,520
It's not perfectly round.

79
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,090
You specify those with rx
10, we'll say, and ry of 25.

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,120
That would create an
ellipse like this one.

81
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,590
Now to use the ellipse
knowledge to round

82
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,090
the corners of our rectangle.

83
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,329
Inside the rect tab, we'll
use the rx and ry attributes

84
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,860
to create an invisible
ellipse that will

85
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,310
be used round the corners.

86
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,460
We can use that same
rx of 10, ry of 25,

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,310
and you'll see that we
get a rectangle that's got

88
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,260
slightly wonky rounded edges.

89
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,590
For our example, we want
evenly rounded edges.

90
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,130
So if we use an rx
of 5 and an ry 5

91
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,290
to create the ellipse shape,
or, in this case, a circle,

92
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,320
we'll get these
rounded edges that we

93
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,610
want to create our icon.

94
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,470
Because the rx and ry that
we're using are the same,

95
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,000
we can simply say
rx of 5, and it will

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,303
use that same value for ry.

97
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:57,803
Yay!

98
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:58,670
Congratulations!

99
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,480
We've made the
Schmuffle phone icon.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,340
So far, we've used the
image tag to include any SVG

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,890
that we wanted on our site.

102
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,230
With this image tag, you're
able to rotate, scale, animate,

103
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,280
on an offscreen,
the SVG as a whole.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,270
However, if you wanted to go
ahead and animate a part of it,

105
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,260
like the icon button,
for instance, and only

106
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,870
the icon button, you
wouldn't be able to do this.

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,360
You have no way to select the
inner elements of the SVG.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
What if we wanted to change the
color of the SVG background?

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,110
Again, no.

110
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,920
You don't have access
to this with CSS

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,430
because you're using the
image tag to include your SVG.

112
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,610
So how can we do some
cool things with styling

113
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,080
or animating to our SVGs?

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,350
There's another
more powerful way,

115
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,180
instead of using an image
tag, to include SVGs.

116
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,480
So instead of having
your image tag,

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,340
take the SVG code
from inside the file,

118
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,240
and put it inline your HTML.

119
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,060
Inline will give us access
to the inner elements

120
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,190
so that we can iterate on
styles, or even animate,

121
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,700
with CSS.

122
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,340
So, here, we've
selected the circle,

123
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,550
and we've added
a grow key frame.

124
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,270
If we go ahead and
check that out,

125
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,020
you'll see, now, that our icon
looks exactly how it did when

126
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,990
we were with the image tag.

127
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,760
But, now, the
circle is animating

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,550
or growing larger and smaller.

129
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,110
Don't worry, if you're not
familiar with animating in CSS,

130
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,020
go ahead and give
circles a spin,

131
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,960
and I'll see you back
in the next section.
