1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,960
Welcome back to the
second section of level 2.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,250
Remember that badge that
we showed back in level 1?

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,190
Well, in order to create
an asset like this in SVG,

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,140
we would need to know a few
more shapes like text, polygon,

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,870
and line in order
to build something

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,940
as fancy as this badge.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,010
To get started, inside our
HTML, because we're not

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,830
using the image
tag anymore, we'll

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,380
go ahead and start our SVG tag.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,299
We'll give it a height
and width of 268.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,170
We'll also specify the version
and the XML namespace here.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,770
Now we're ready to build
the circle element.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,990
Inside the SVG,
we'll say circle.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,330
We'll give it a radius,
a center x and y point.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,580
And if you'll notice with
our badge, it has no fill.

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,740
So we'll say fill of none.

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,890
We'll give it this green
hexadecimal stroke.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,115
And a stroke width
of seven pixels.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,270
So far, we've only
done our styles inline,

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,030
inside the tags themselves.

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,040
However, there is another way.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,060
With our link tag, we can
include a CSS stylesheet

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,360
and go ahead and move the
fill, stroke, and stroke width

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,160
into our CSS.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,140
It's really important to note
that when you do styles inside

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,080
of an SVG tag, unit identifiers
like pixels, percentages, EMS,

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,380
those aren't required at all.

28
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,870
But when you move them into
CSS, they are required.

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,770
So as you'll see,
7 changed to 7px.

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,890
Just keep that in
mind for future use.

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,600
If you'll notice though,
our radius, cx and cy,

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,430
are all inside of our tag still.

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,300
This is because anything
that sets a coordinate

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,026
should stay inline.

35
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:53,650
Very important.

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,170
We have our circle.

37
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,680
So we're ready to
go ahead and build

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,105
the line that's below the
triangle in the badge.

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,669
So inside our SVG tag, below the
circle, we can use a line tag.

40
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,450
To draw a line, you need to
specify 2 x and y points.

41
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,250
One for the start
of the line and one

42
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,930
for the end of the line.

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,540
For our example, we'll have
an x1 of 47, y1 of 198,

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,390
an x2 of 221, and a y2 of 198.

45
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,190
So it's a straight line.

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,310
Inside our stylesheet,
we'll call out the line tag.

47
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,690
We'll give it a stroke
of black and a stroke

48
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,175
width of five pixels.

49
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,330
Now when we load it up, we
have our circle and our line.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,570
We're getting there.

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,860
Next step though, we'll need
to add some text and a polygon

52
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,960
to our badge.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,590
Next step, we'll
use the text element

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,970
to add SVG to our badge.

55
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,990
We'll say text,
give it an x and y

56
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,430
so it's centered on
our screen, and the SVG

57
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,700
in the middle of the opening
and closing text tags.

58
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,050
Inside our stylesheet, we'll
say text font-size 60 pixels.

59
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,180
If we load the badge
up in the browser,

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,470
you'll see that we do have
the SVG text in the badge.

61
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,220
However, it's not centered.

62
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,100
What is going on here?

63
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,550
Well, unlike everything
else that we've

64
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,050
learned so far in SVG, the
default anchor point for text

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,070
is in the bottom left.

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,800
This can simply
be adjusted though

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,230
by saying text-anchor
middle inside your CSS.

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,330
Refresh and you'll
see now that the text

69
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,470
is centered as expected.

70
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,570
Our text could use some
sprucing up, however.

71
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,594
So inside the stylesheet,
we'll say

72
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,300
font-family 'FilmotypeMajor'.

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,500
Stroke of black, stroke-width
of three pixels, and a fill

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,790
of this white cream color.

75
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,880
This font family isn't one
that all browsers will have

76
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,910
by default. So we'll probably
want to use @font-face when we

77
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,680
put this into production.

78
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,110
We have a course,
Front-end Formations,

79
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,560
that covers @font-face in detail.

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
So head on over there if
you have any questions.

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,870
If we look at our
index.html as a whole now,

82
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,680
you'll see that the
circle, line, and text all

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,240
have coordinate
setting attributes

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
that are still inline.

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,140
Again, it's so important that
I'm reiterating it twice.

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,770
Please leave any coordinate
setting attributes

87
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,640
inline and not in your CSS.

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,230
We're so close to being done.

89
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,720
We have one last shape we
need to add for our badge

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,540
to be complete, and
that's the polygon.

91
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:52,030
Inside our HTML, below
all the other elements,

92
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,000
we can say polygon.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,460
And a polygon, unlike
the other elements,

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,320
takes multiple points.

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,920
So we'll say points.

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,890
And we'll give it three
different sets of points.

97
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,820
This is for the starting,
the top, and the endpoint

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,060
that make up the triangle.

99
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,160
Inside our stylesheet,
we'll go ahead and give it

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,530
a blue-green fill, a black
stroke, and a stroke-width

101
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,170
of two pixels.

102
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,240
This is what the triangle look
like with these styles applied.

103
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,170
When we load our entire
badge in the browser,

104
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,620
however, we'll see that
something not so awesome

105
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,240
is happening.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,300
The triangle is smack
right on top of the text.

107
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,910
We can't see our
SVG text anymore.

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,820
This is because just
like HTML elements,

109
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,859
SVG elements stack on top
of each other in the order

110
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,900
that they were specified.

111
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,130
Super simple fix.

112
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,400
Put the polygon line
above the text line

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,940
so that your polygon
is drawn in first

114
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,200
and then your text is
drawn on top of it.

115
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,870
Now when we refresh,
we have the badge

116
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,470
that we set out to create using
not only circle, but text,

117
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,790
polygon, and line as well.

118
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,990
Go have fun practicing
all these new elements

119
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,050
that you just learned.

120
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,920
And I'll see you back
in the next level.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,331
--work on that line.

122
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:21,830
Ugh.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,820
Our text be ugly, though.

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,290
So let's get it some style.

125
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,380
Sheet will say--

126
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,436
Is it?

127
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,210
OK.

128
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,760
Whoops.
