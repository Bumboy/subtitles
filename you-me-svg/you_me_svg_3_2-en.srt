00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,300
This is You, Me, and SVG,
level three, section two.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,360
In this section we're talking
about transforms a little bit

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,170
more.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,810
In the last section
we used transform

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,600
to translate or to move
things around on the page.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,750
But as we mentioned, you can
also rotate or scale things

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,830
with the transform attribute.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,070
Let's see if we can
modify our badge

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,630
by rotating the top
two triangle groups

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,800
and scaling the bottom one.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,650
To rotate this top
left group of polygons,

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,660
we'll use transform's
rotate property.

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,680
Right next to translate,
we'll say rotate.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,030
And rotate takes three values.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,560
The first is the
degrees to rotate.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,800
And the second are the x
and y to rotate around.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,250
If you just specify the
first value of the degrees

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,110
the x and y will
default to 0,0.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,900
However, in our example, we want
to rotate around the center,

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,900
so 12.5 12.5.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,680
As you would imagine,
rotating the second group

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,130
is just as easy.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,870
We'll say rotate, but
instead of 10 we'll

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,880
say negative 10 degrees.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,760
We'll also give it the center
x and y to rotate around.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,900
Static rotations like
this will use numbers

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,780
between 360 and negative 360.

29
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,990
For our last group, in
order to shrink it down,

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,480
make it smaller, we're going to
use transforms scale property.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,800
Next to translate
will say scale,

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,060
and scale takes one value.

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,460
And this is a modifier
that your scaling with.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,590
So if I said scale 1, nothing
would change about the group.

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,220
They would stay
exactly the same.

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,490
If I say scale 2, they
would be twice the size.

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,020
So on and so forth.

38
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,410
So in order to get the
desired effect of a smaller

39
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,740
bottom group, we're
going to say scale 0.6.

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,070
When we load it up now you'll
see that it is scaling,

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,020
however it looks a bit
off center, just a smidge.

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,880
This is because the group
is scaling from 0,0.

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,050
If you remember, with
most things, not text,

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,970
but with most things,
that 0,0 is the top left.

45
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,220
So when the triangle group
scales from the top left

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,680
it probably looks
like it's moving over

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,660
to the left a little bit.

48
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,110
The only way that
you can adjust this

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,450
is by chaining on
another translation.

50
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,600
For this example, we need to go
ahead and translate it 8 by 8.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,400
For other examples
based on your scaling

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,450
those numbers will be different.

53
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,250
Our triangle groups are
now rotating and scaling

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,190
as expected, and
we're looking good.

55
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,590
You've learned not
only how to translate,

56
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,950
but how to rotate and
scale with transform.

57
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,550
Go practice that
in the challenges

58
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,040
and I'll see you back for
this levels last section.
