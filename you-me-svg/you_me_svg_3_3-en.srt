00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,800
Welcome to level three, section
three, in You, Me, & SVG!

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,410
In this section,
we'll be covering

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,260
how to responsibly create
icons or assets in SVG.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,440
I'll have to admit, the
assets and icons that we've

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,110
created thus far are
looking really good,

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,550
no matter what screen
size they're on.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,040
However, they're
still not responsive

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,655
based on the screen size.

9
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:28,890
And what do I mean by this?

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,892
Well, take our
badge for example.

11
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,350
If we go and load
it in the browser

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,500
and change the browser's width,
the badge stays the same.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,730
It doesn't change.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,080
Wouldn't it be great if our
SVG's width was a percentage,

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,310
and it changed as the
browser's width changed.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,530
In order to create responsive
icons or assets in SVG,

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,720
we need to revisit
our coordinate system.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,490
Back in level one, when
we first created SVGs,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,620
we set a height and width.

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,500
That height and width
is the viewport.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,650
This is the base
coordinate system

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,330
that anything inside
our SVG lives within.

23
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,160
As we saw with groups,
it's possible to have

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,500
nested coordinate systems
inside this viewport.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,970
Well, for our
responsive asset, we

26
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,590
want to create another
coordinate system, called

27
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,880
the viewBox.

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,900
We'll copy our viewport values,
those static 268 by 268,

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,270
and we'll put them
on the viewBox.

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,080
These two coordinate
systems are overlapping.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,270
Their 0,0's are on
top of each other.

32
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,682
In our graph, they're not,
because that would be insane.

33
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,265
But in real life,
they're overlapping.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,530
The second step is to give
our viewport responsive values

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,460
for the height and width.

36
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,610
So here, you can see that
we gave our height of auto

37
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,080
and our width of 50%.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,130
Now when we resize
our screen, you'll

39
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,570
see that the badge is
growing or shrinking

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,050
based on the screen's width.

41
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,970
Now let's actually
do this in our code.

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,949
Inside the SVG, we'll
take that 268 by 268

43
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,700
for the height and width,
and we'll move that

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,670
into the viewBox attribute.

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,170
Now, viewBox takes
four things total,

46
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,920
and the second two are
the width and height

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,240
that we just set, 268 by 268.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,290
The first two are the
origin, the x and y.

49
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,860
And as we said, we want
ours to match up and be 0,0.

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,860
So we'll just say 0,0.

51
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,960
Now all we need to do is
set those responsive values

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,930
for our viewport inside the CSS.

53
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,340
We'll say SVG, give it a height
of auto and a width of 50%.

54
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,180
And as you can see, we're
getting the responsive growing

55
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,380
and shrinking badge with our
screen size as it changes.

56
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,090
Go practice using the
new coordinate system

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,160
called viewBox to create some
responsive icons or assets,

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,635
and I'll see you back
in the final level.

59
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,495
[LAUGHING]

60
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:11,960
Why don't you go practice them.

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I don't know.

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880
[INAUDIBLE]

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,830
Level three.

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,590

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,490
Just read the slide, ma'am.

66
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,040
OK.
