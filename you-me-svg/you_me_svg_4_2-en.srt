1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,330
You're watching You, Me and SVG.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,770
This is level four,
section two, and we'll

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,760
be talking about symbols.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,066
So far we've been creating
icons and assets in isolation.

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,440
But most of the
time you're going

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,060
to include them on a web page
with a bunch of other HTML

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,630
elements going on.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,170
Here you can see we're
using this phone icon twice.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,820
One time up in the header,
and the second time

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,050
below the paragraph.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,080
This is what it would
look like inside the HTML.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,650
You've got your body tag,
you've got your SVG up

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,010
at the top, the header,
and then a paragraph,

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,750
and your second SVG.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,960
If you need to use icons or
elements in multiple places,

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,930
there is something
magical called symbol.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,470
Symbol is what people
use, very commonly,

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,200
to wrap around icons, and
reuse them over and over again.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,390
To define a symbol that we can
use multiple times on a page,

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,940
the first step is to
make the symbol tag.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,920
We give it an ID of phone,
and inside the symbol tag

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,500
is all of the code that's used
to draw that phone, or icon.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,590
Since we're just defining
an icon for later use,

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,830
we don't actually want
to see it up here.

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,740
So inside our style
sheet, we'll call out

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,700
the defined-icon, which
is a class on our SVG,

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,460
and we'll give it
a display of none.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,880
Throughout the course,
we refactored our styles

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,150
from inline into
the style sheet.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,140
So the same with
this phone icon.

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,130
The styles are coming from
inside our style sheet.

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,770
So now.

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,690
to use the symbol
that we defined above,

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,990
we'll create a new SVG.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,510
We'll give it things like
the name space and version

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,800
that it needs.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,430
And then we'll also
give it a viewbox.

38
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,810
This viewbox goes on the
second SVG, the SVG that's

39
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,560
actually displaying the icon.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,340
Inside this SVG, we'll use
something called the use tag.

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,199
The use tag takes an
xlink href attribute.

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,400
That attribute points to
whatever icon or element

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,810
needs to be pulled in.

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,580
So in this case, it's
pointing to the ID of phone.

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,710
This is really important.

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,150
You can't point to a class,
you have to point to an ID.

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,090
Just like we gave the
browser a heads up that hey,

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,630
we need to use a
different type of XML,

49
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,800
when we use the XML namespace.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,700
Now we need to give it
a heads up that we're

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,940
going to use an xlink.

52
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,150
So on the SVG that
has the used tag,

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,090
we're going to say
xmlns colon xlink,

54
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,995
and give it a link
to those docs.

55
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,370
The use tags xlink points
to a named anchor--

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,370
the ID of phone, in our case.

57
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,000
This can also be an outside
source, like a file.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,200
However, IE 10 and below don't
support that just a heads up.

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,330
As we did in the last
level, let's go ahead

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,680
and give this phone icon, that
were reusing multiple times,

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,850
a responsive width and height.

62
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,710
We've already given the
viewbox the static 80 by 110.

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,930
Now inside the stylesheet, we'll
call out the displayed icon,

64
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,821
and give it a height of
auto and a width of 30%.

65
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,460
So in real life, if we opened
up the site inside our editor,

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,470
we would see an index that
has all of these elements.

67
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,990
With the SVG defined at
the top, and then below,

68
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,340
we're using the
element multiple times.

69
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,220
We also have our
styles for the top

70
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,740
displayed-icon, the defined-icon,
 and the displayed-icon

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,780
here.

72
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,610
That are making the
top icon smaller

73
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,020
than the bottom larger icon.

74
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,310
You can style them
differently with use,

75
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,960
and it cleans up your
code quite a bit.

76
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,950
Now for my personal favorite
part, accessibility.

77
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,500
SVG has two elements that make
accessibility possible, title

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,390
and description.

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,140
So inside our SVG, we can give
it a title of schmuffle phone

80
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,080
icon.

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,290
We can also give a
description like,

82
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,560
a phone with a large red
border with rounded corners,

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,740
so on and so forth.

84
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,030
Now to most people,
these two tags

85
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,810
don't really mean that much.

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,610
But to a blind person, now
when they're on your site,

87
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,600
they can see or imagine
in their head based

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,070
on the description and
the title that you just

89
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,710
provided for your asset.

90
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,280
Let's go ahead and
look and listen in

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,780
on what a screen reader would
do for our small example site.

92
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,720
SVG symbols, Schmuffle
Phone, Schmuffle Phone Specs.

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,150
Easy to use yet
schmuffle phone icon.

94
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,200
A phone with a large red
border with rounded corners.

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,560
A white screen, and
a white round button

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
centered below the screen.

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,030
It has been so much fun doing
this SVG course with you.

98
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,670
I hope you rock those
last few challenges,

99
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,891
where you go over
symbol, and also

100
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,140
a little bit of accessibility.

101
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,385
For the future, and beyond.

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,390
Gregg!

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,940
Pav-- Out of the room.

104
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,320
Styled or animated.
