00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,206
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:03,590
[SINGING] It's time
to learn some Python,

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,830
a language to rely on, from
printing strings to math

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,340
routines, variables
on the horizon.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,570
Start using True/False
and conditionals,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,040
as you Try Python's
basic principals.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,860
Welcome to Try Python.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,550
I'm Sarah Buchanan, and we'll
be covering Python basics

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,690
in this course,
starting with Level 1:

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,630
Birds and Coconuts,
covering math and variables.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,240
Before we begin
our Python journey,

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,540
let's go over why
Python is awesome.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,060
Python is known for being
easy to learn, easy to read,

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,480
but it's also
incredibly powerful,

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,420
making it great for
beginners and experts alike.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,440
It also has expansive
library support,

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,110
meaning you can
download libraries

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,620
for pretty much anything,
from image processing

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,760
to data analysis
to creating games.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
With all of these great
reasons to learn Python,

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,170
let's get started.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,620
Python is an
interpreted language,

23
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,360
and the interpreter
shell is shown here,

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,470
and we can type numbers
and commands into it

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,210
just like a calculator.

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,240
For example, we could type
35 into the interpreter,

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,990
and it'll just
return it back to us.

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,960
Any time you see >>>
 like this,

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,970
it means we're entering
code into the interpreter,

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,250
and the green arrow is the
result of running that code.

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,080
For example, if we
enter a number 30.5,

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,335
we just get it back.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,480
The interpreter will evaluate
any mathematical expression

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,540
we type in, and supports
basic operators like addition.

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,570
For example, we could
type in 3 + 5,

36
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,300
and we get the result of 8.

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,820
It also supports basic
operators like subtraction,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,970
multiplication,
division, exponent, which

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,100
is **,
and negation,

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,950
which is just a minus sign.

41
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,410
Python has two types of
numbers, whole numbers

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,230
called ints and
decimals called floats.

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,590
Any time you see a number
without a decimal point,

44
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,714
it's an int, and we'll be using
those terms, int and float,

45
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:30,630
throughout the course.

46
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,530
In Python, just like any
programming language,

47
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,130
the order of operations matters.

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,910
In the expression on
the left, (5 + 7)

49
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,840
is evaluated first because
of the parentheses.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
Then behind the scenes,
we have 12 * 3,

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,270
with a final result of 36.

52
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,420
Any time you see this icon,
that means we're showing you

53
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,580
behind the scenes steps.

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,430
On the right, without the
parentheses, 7 * 3

55
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,010
happens first.

56
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,380
So behind the scenes, we have
5 + 21, with a result of 26.

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,470
The order is an easy to
remember mnemonic: PEMDAS, which

58
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,790
stands for Parentheses,
Exponent, Multiplication,

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,550
Division, Addition, Subtraction.

60
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,470
Let's apply our Python math
knowledge to a common math

61
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,400
problem in the Monty Python
world: can a swallow carry

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
a coconut?

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,170
What we know is, a
swallow weighs 60 grams.

64
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,480
And we'll assume
that a swallow can

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,780
carry a third of
its weight, even

66
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,730
though that's dependent on
air speed and other factors.

67
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,470
If we divide 60
grams by 3, we see

68
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,320
that a swallow can
carry 20 grams,

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,400
but a coconut
weighs 1450 grams.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,620
Obviously, a swallow
can't carry a coconut.

71
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,610
So how many swallows
would it take?

72
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,750
We divide the coconut's
weight, 1450,

73
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,040
by the swallow's carrying
limit, 60 divided by 3.

74
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,560
This will tell us
how many swallows it

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,800
will take to carry a coconut.

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,089
We get 8.06, which
seems way too low.

77
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,630
We may have messed up
the math somewhere.

78
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,300
If we take a closer look at
what got evaluated first,

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,520
we see we may have
made an error.

80
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,250
We actually want 60 divided
by 3 to be evaluated first,

81
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,770
and we can add
parentheses to fix this.

82
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,680
When we add the
parentheses, we get

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,110
the correct answer
of 72.5 swallows

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,900
to carry a coconut, which
is a lot of swallows.

85
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,510
And now it's your
turn to practice

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,540
writing your first Python
code in the challenges.

87
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,360
Have fun.
