00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:01,880
Hello.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,570
I'm Gregg Pollack, and you're
watching Try iOS, and this is

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,970
level three, where we're going
to be going over tabs, images,

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,860
and scrolling.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,140
But before we get into it, we
need to talk about the demo

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,250
app that we're going to be
building together over the

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,610
remainder of the course.

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,180
It's called InstaPhoto.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,620
It has three main pieces
of functionality.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,510
The first, it has
a photo feed.

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,470
So we can view the latest photos
off of the internet.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,400
It then has a favorites
tab where we can

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,510
save photos for later.

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,759
And then finally, it has a
profiles tab, which we can see

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,580
information about ourselves
and edit that information.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,680
How very original.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,630
Yeah.

18
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,310
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,390
It's not totally original, but
it's a good demonstration of

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,560
what you can do with iOS.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,140
Our topic list for level three
looks something like this.

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,940
First, we're going to introduce
the UITabBarController,

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,150
then we're going
to add images to the tabs.

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,530
Then we're going to refactor
our view controllers.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,170
We're going to add images to
our view controllers, and

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,300
finally, we'll learn about
UI scroll view.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,670
The applications we've built
thus far only have one view

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,660
controller, right?

29
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,680
There's a window, it points to
a view controller, which

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,594
points to a view.

31
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:15,450
A view controller should only
have one primary job.

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,720
Right.

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,940
It should only have one primary
job, which means as

34
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,970
our application gets more
complex and has different

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,300
behaviors, we're probably going
to want to separate

36
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,075
those behaviors out into
different view controllers.

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,170
Let's take a look inside a
common iOS application, and

38
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,540
see if we can figure out how
it might separate its

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,980
different view controllers.

40
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,470
So inside the Clock app, we have
the World Clock, we have

41
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,140
the Alarm Settings, we
have the Stopwatch,

42
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,900
and we have the Timer.

43
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,820
These are each separate
functionalities.

44
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,230
So if we were to get access to
the code, odds are we would

45
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,150
find that it has a World Clock
view controller, it has an

46
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,020
Alarm view controller, it has
a Stopwatch view controller,

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,110
and it has a Timer
view controller.

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,080
And that is controlled by the
UI tab bar controller, which

49
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,940
is a type of container
view controller.

50
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,650
Meaning that it contains
other view controllers.

51
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,660
So we have our window
here at the top.

52
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,850
Then our Window is going to
point to our UI tab bar

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,550
controller.

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,810
In this case, our window's view
controller is set to

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,110
UITabBarController, which
contains the rest of our view

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,340
controllers.

57
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,770
As you might have already
imagined, when you tap on the

58
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,070
different tabs, the UITabBarController
will display the

59
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,580
corresponding view controller.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,260
Let's jump back into our
application.m and

61
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,980
implement a  UITabBarController.

62
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,480
So first step here is we
allocate the memory for and

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,040
initialize it.

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,530
We don't need to create
it as a subclass.

65
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,120
We can just instantiate
it here.

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,060
And we'll set our window root
view controller equal to the

67
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,750
tab bar controller.

68
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,080
Now, we can't run this
code as it is yet.

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,090
We need to add some view
controllers inside of it.

70
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,770
We're building InstaPhoto,
and InstaPhoto

71
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,120
has a feed of photos.

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
So let's create  feedViewController, just like so.

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,780
Give it a title, which will
be the title of the tab.

74
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,110
And then we'll create
favoritesViewController, and

75
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,600
also set the title as well.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,190
Then let's at these each to a
different background color, so

77
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,550
we can tell we're switching
back and

78
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,610
forth between the two.

79
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,430
And then finally, we send the
setViewControllers message

80
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,200
into the tab bar controller, and
send it the view controllers

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,590
that it should contain.

82
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,230
By default, the first view
controller in this list will

83
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,710
be shown when we start
up our application.

84
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,120
So here we are inside of our UI
tab bar controller, and we

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,760
can switch back and forth
between two to switch between

86
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,675
blue and red.

87
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,998
Just add a police siren, and
you could pull someone oer

88
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,180
with this app.

89
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,830
Very funny, Mr. Higgie.

90
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,310
And now it's time for you to
jump into the code and start

91
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,630
creating some tabs of your own.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,880
