1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,620
So now you know how
to determine which

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,590
cell has been tapped.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,810
But how do we use that
information to then push to

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,310
another ViewController which
will then display that image?

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,590
To do this it's going to
take a couple steps.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,310
First we're going to create a
PhotoViewController class.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,030
Inside of that it's going to
have an @property which stores

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,740
the imageFileName which is--
we're going to figure out by

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,730
looking at the table which
cell was pressed.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,200
Then we're going to create a
UIImageView to show the image

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,890
in that ViewController.

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,710
And finally we'll modify
our TableView's

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,270
didSelectRowAtIndexPath method
so that it creates this

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,730
ViewController, sets the file
name that we want to show, and

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,020
then uses the navigation
controller to display that new

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,800
ViewController.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,260
All right.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,150
So let's create a
PhotoViewController.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,200
We've done this before.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,900
We go and create a new file.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,680
It's an Objective C Class.

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,730
And it's a UIViewController,
creates two files for us.

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,800
Pretty simple.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,920
Now we need to define
that property.

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,690
So inside the
PhotoViewController.h, we

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,740
define a string, which
is the imageFileName

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,210
that we want to display.

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,800
Then inside of the
PhotoViewController, inside

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,470
the viewDidLoad, we're going to
create a UIImageView, which

30
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,700
will display in the middle
of the screen, and

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,950
add that as a subview.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,900
Our last step is to jump back
into our TableViewController

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,710
in the didSelectRowAtIndexPath
method.

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,940
Inside there, we're going
to instantiate a

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,810
PhotoViewController.

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,140
Then we're going to set the
imageFileName based on the

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,370
index path that was sent in, and
then finally we're going

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,070
to push control to that
ViewController using our

39
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,320
navigationController.

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,860
That's all there is to it, and
I know you must be eager to

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,750
play around with it.

42
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,400
But before we go there, let's
take a moment to talk about

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,290
different cell styles.

44
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,060
So here we're using the
CellStyleDefault, but there's

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,430
a couple other ones that
you should know about.

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,150
So here we have

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,230
CellStyleValue1, Value2, and Subtitle.

48
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,650
And on the left side, you can
see how these are displayed.

49
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,890
You already know how to
set the textLabel.

50
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,980
To set the detailTextLabel,
you would do

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,350
something like this.

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,870
And then finally, if you
wanted to set a image

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,260
thumbnail on the left side, you
would use the syntax I'm

54
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,240
showing here.

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,130
Now it's time for you to build
out the rest of our

56
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,380
FeedTableViewController.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,887
