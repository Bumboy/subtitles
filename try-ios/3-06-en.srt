00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,650
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,890
Here's our AppDelegate again.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,940
And the code in here, well, it's
starting to feel a little

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,680
bit cluttered.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,040
You need to create
FeedViewController to

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,930
encapsulate the behavior.

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,450
Right, Mr. Higgie.

8
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,420
We need to encapsulate all of
the behavior inside of a

9
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,390
ViewController.

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,500
Remember back in level one we
had a ViewController class?

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,590
Just like that, we need to
create some classes here,

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,480
maybe one called
FeedViewController.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,930
To do that, if you're in Xcode,
you're going to go up,

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,290
and you're going to
select New File.

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,150
Then you're going to select
Objective C Class.

16
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,690
Then you'll specify the name of
this class-- in this case,

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,040
FeedViewController.

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,530
And it's important that you
specify the subclass of this

19
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,580
class, because it's going to
create some boilerplate code

20
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,560
for you inside of that subclass
that we're creating.

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,070
These are the files that will be
created, FeedViewController

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,120
dot m and dot h.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,230
And it'll also add this file to
be compiled when you build

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,480
the application.

25
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,485
So now let's go back into the
old code, and let's refactor

26
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:03,360
it to use this
FeedViewController that we

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,319
just created.

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,160
We need to do two things here.

29
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,550
First, we need to import the new
class, and then we need to

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,330
use the new class.

31
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,880
So let's do that.

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,900
So here's our import line
at the top, import

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,870
FeedViewController.h.

34
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,370
And then we just simply use
FeedViewController,

35
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,410
FeedViewController.

36
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,380
And that's all there
really is to it.

37
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,990
However, now we need to move
the ViewController behavior

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,670
into this FeedViewController.

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,280
So those are those two lines
right there at the bottom.

40
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,720
So here's the FeedViewController
that was

41
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,950
created for us, and it gives us
this initialization method

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,140
that is really quite ugly.

43
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,300
This is one of those submarine
knobs and instrumentation.

44
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,360
You can just ignore it.

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,410
Don't try to understand it.

46
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,440
Just understand that inside of
this if conditional is where

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,460
you put your custom
implementation.

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,790
Namely, here we're going
to put the title

49
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,580
and the tabBar image.

50
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,020
Then inside of our viewDidLoad
at the bottom, that's where we

51
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,830
can put our background color and
create additional subviews

52
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,150
if we'd like.

53
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,610
Now it's time for you to finish
up our refactoring, and

54
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,860
I'll see you in a minute.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,084
