1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,230
So we have a table.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,810
And we need to load some
data into the table.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,630
And well, we have
a list of items.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,240
So obviously we might want to
load that data from an array.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,680
Let's review NSArray.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,890
So to create an NSArray of
strings, we would do

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,440
something like that.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
Then to reference values from
that array we simply just

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,530
specify the index.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,570
In this case we're reading out
the second object, which is

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,040
going to print out Eric.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,200
We can also send in a
variable to get the

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,900
index for that array.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,270
In this case, the fourth object
in the array, or John.

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,460
To determine how many elements
are in an array, we simply use

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,240
the count property.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,170
This is going to be really
useful when we need to tell

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,500
our table how many
cells are in it.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
If we're dealing with an array,
we can simply return

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,860
the count of items
in that array.

21
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,230
One more method that's really
useful that we can declare

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,060
inside our
FeedTableViewController is

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,900
tableview  didSelectRowAtIndexPath.

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,550
So didSelect- this gets called
whenever you tap

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,420
on one of the cells.

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,320
And the index path parameter
tells you which

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,730
cell has been tapped.

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,150
If we call .row it's going
to give you back an integer,

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,060
which represents the index
of that tapped cell.

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,730
We can also call
indexPath.section if you want

31
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,350
to figure out which section
that cell is in.

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,120
So in the challenges coming
up, we're going

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,020
to give you an array.

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,050
You're going to use that
array, to populate the

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,700
different cells of table.

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,530
And then to figure out which
cell has been tapped.

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,780
Good luck.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,127
