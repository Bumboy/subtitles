1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,400
Next up, let's try to figure
out how to add

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,030
pictures onto our views.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,690
So here inside viewDidLoad--

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,510
that's where we add subviews--

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,010
we're going to create
a UIImage view.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,700
It's going to be called
greggView.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,280
We're going to allocate the
memory for it and initialize

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,930
it by sending in a UIImage.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,330
Notice here that I'm
specifying the file

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,290
name with a dot jpg.

11
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,240
Because it's not a png, we need
to specify the extension.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,380
We want this view to take
up the entire screen.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,310
So instead of sending in the x,
y width and height, we're

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,670
going to set the ContentMode
to ScaleAspectFit.

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,470
We're then going to set the
frame of this image equal to

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,030
the frame of the view that
it's in so it'll

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,330
be the whole frame.

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,880
And then, of course, we just
need to add it as a subview.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,680
Let's go through this
one more time.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,170
So we're creating a view for
displaying the image.

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,370
It's not a png, so we need
to specify the extension.

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,880
We have the ContentMode, which
determines how a view lays out

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,230
the content.

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,210
We set the frame, which
describes the view's

25
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,940
location and size.

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,250
And then lastly, we add
it as a subview.

27
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,490
Now it's time for you to add
some of your own images, and

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,740
I'll catch you on
the flip side.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,234
