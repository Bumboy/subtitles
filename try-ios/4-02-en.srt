00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:01,550
Hello.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,390
I'm Gregg Pollack.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,010
And you're watching Try iOS.

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,200
This is level four, where we're
going to be going over

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,320
UINavigationController
and custom buttons.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,740
Our topics look something
like this.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,570
We're going to start out with
UINavigationController, then

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,810
figure out how to do custom
buttons, how to create custom

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,970
View Controllers on the fly.

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,170
And then finally, we'll figure
out how to use both navigation

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,610
and TabBar Controllers
together.

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,600
How else can we navigate
ViewControllers?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,410
Well, let's pop open another app
and see if we can figure

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,900
out how they do it.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,010
Here inside of our settings
iPhone app, you can see we

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,380
maybe have the
SettingsViewController.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,650
Then, maybe also when we
click on something, the

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,100
GeneralViewController for
the general settings.

19
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,550
And then you have the
AboutViewController.

20
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,260
You can probably see where
this is going.

21
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,500
Here's a quick video, where
you can see where in the

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,920
SettingsController, we'll
click on General.

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,610
That pushes control to the
GeneralViewController.

24
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,270
And that pushes control to
the AboutViewControl.

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,740
It's almost like we're pushing
and popping from a stack of

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,890
ViewControllers.

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,800
Look up at the top there.

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,599
Settings.

29
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,110
Now we're in General.

30
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,180
Now we're in About.

31
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,950
And it remembers where
we came from.

32
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,470
So it remembers that the
settings is where we started,

33
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,790
so we can pop those other
ViewControllers off of our

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,430
virtual stack.

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,890
Let's jump back into our code
from the previous level, where

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,350
we were using the
tabBarController.

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,250
And let's revise it to use
the NavigationController.

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,100
So let's take away the tabBar.

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,530
And now what we're going
to do is create a

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,500
UINavigationController.

41
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,160
And you'll notice here we
initialize it by sending in

42
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,200
our FeedViewController.

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,240
Then, when we go to set our
window.rootViewController, we

44
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,700
just set it equal to our new
NavigationController.

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,060
Now if we go to our application,
we would see

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,250
something that looks
like this.

47
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,450
You can see that title
bar across the top.

48
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,070
And it actually defaulted to
Feed, which is just the name

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,490
of the ViewController.

50
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,800
FeedViewController, so it took
Feed and assumed that was the

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,630
name, and put it
up at the top.

52
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,650
Pretty cool.

53
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,360
Now if we wanted to push to
another ViewController, we

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,160
would use this piece of code
you see here, where we push

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,130
onto our stack another
ViewController.

56
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,780
So now that we're in our
FeedViewController, how might

57
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,370
we create a button that
then pushes to our

58
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,800
FavoritesViewController?

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,320
To do this, we're going
to jump into our

60
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,570
FeedViewController.

61
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,310
And inside viewDidLoad under our
background color, we're going

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,240
to create a UI button.

63
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,630
This should all look
very familiar.

64
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,360
Then we're going to add a
target to the Favorites

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,070
button, so that when somebody
presses this button, it calls

66
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,680
the new showFavorites
method, which we are

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,430
now about to define.

68
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,510
Inside showFavorites, we're
going to instantiate a new

69
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,510
FavoritesViewController.

70
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,910
Then, since our
FeedViewController is wrapped

71
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,680
in a NavigationController,
we can call

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,900
self.navigationController, get
a hold of it, and then send a

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,170
message, pushViewController,
and then push our

74
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,250
FavoritesViewController
onto our stack.

75
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,620
If we built and ran the
application, here's what it

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,120
would look like.

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,260
So we start out in the
FeedViewController.

78
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,950
And when we press the button,
we're pushed to the

79
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,340
FavoritesViewController.

80
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,130
But it remembers that our first
ViewController was the

81
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,360
FeedViewController, so we can
navigate easily back and forth

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,610
between the two.

83
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,980
Now it's time for you to
play around with the

84
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,230
NavigationController.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,978
