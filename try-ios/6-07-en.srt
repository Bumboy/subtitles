1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,890
Here's the feed view table
view controller, which you

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,460
helped us build.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,240
How might we load data from the
internet to populate the

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,460
latest photos?

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,260
Well here's the URL that we
might use, and here's the data

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,822
that might get returned.

7
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:16,129
That's an NSArray of
NSDictionaries.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,590
You're right, Mr. Higgie.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,990
We can see the brackets here,
which tell us it's probably

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,860
going to be an NSArray
of NSDictonaries.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,400
So to get the data that we want
out of this NSArray, we

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,440
first need to give it the index
of the array that we

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,840
want, and then the key for the
value that we want from the

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,070
NSDictionary.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,060
So in this case we would
get back image one.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,270
If we sent this in, we
would get image two.

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,500
And if we sent this in, with the
detail key, we would get

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,270
back, some bright stars here.

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,780
Just like we did before with
the ProfileViewController,

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,680
we're going to specify a
property to store what comes

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,530
back from our AF networking
library.

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,150
In this case it's going to
be an NSArray of photos.

23
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,200
So we're going to
specify that.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,629
Then inside the
FeedViewController we have our

25
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,620
AF JSON Request Operation.

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,090
Inside there we're simply going
to set this property.

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,370
Then unlike our previous
example, we need

28
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,820
to redraw the table.

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,430
This basically goes through and
redraws each table cell.

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,010
Because we've loaded this data
from the internet, we need to

31
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,940
go back and redraw each cell
with this new data.

32
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,300
Then we specify what to
do on failure, and

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,620
finally start the operation.

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,410
In order for your table view to
use this data that we just

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,170
fetched using AF networking,
there's a couple things we

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,730
need to do.

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,040
And we're going to leave them
to you in the challenges.

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,390
Here are the steps.

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,790
First, we're going to have to
revise the number of rows in

40
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,300
section to return the number
of photos from the array.

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,110
Then, we have to revise the
cellForRowIndexPath so that it

42
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,700
accesses the particular
NSDictionary, from what we got

43
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,840
returned from the internet.

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,090
And then lastly, we have to
revise didSelectRowIndexPath

45
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,130
so it'll pass the proper
values to our

46
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,470
PhotoViewController,
and display it

47
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,150
big, full on the screen.

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,925
Good luck.

49
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,377
Once you complete all of these,
you'll see the app in

50
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,627
action, you lucky duck.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,199
