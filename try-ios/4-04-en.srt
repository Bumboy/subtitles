1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,262
Now, let's jump back into our
Favorites View Controller.

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,742
Wouldn't it be nice if clicking
that button linked to

3
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:07,740
a bigger image?

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,640
It would be nice, Mr. Higgie.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,200
How might we do that so when
we click on that button it

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,700
brings us to a full
view image?

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,620
And is that image in another
view controller?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,700
And how do we push
that onto the

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,250
Navigation Controller stack?

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,430
So if we jump back into the
Favorites View Controller, as

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,410
we did before, we can see here
we are creating a UIImageView.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,370
Instead of that, we're going
to create a UIButton.

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,750
This button is of type custom.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,610
We're then going to set the
image for this button for

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,040
State Normal.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,470
But we also have to set the
image for State Highlighted.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,860
We have to do this because
it's a custom button.

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,130
You might be able to derive from
these two lines of code

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,880
how you might have a custom
press state for a button.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,830
So you might have one image--
what it looks like when it's

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,950
not pressed, another
image when it's

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,280
highlighted or pressed.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,510
We then have to set the
frame of the button.

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,519
And then finally, we're going to
add an action so that when

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,340
somebody touches this button, it
calls a method called show

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,210
zoomed picture, which we're
going to define in a moment.

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,240
So now, we have a button
that looks like this.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,180
And we need to figure out how
to send control to another

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,910
view controller.

30
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,910
So we need to create another
view controller which displays

31
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,520
the image in a full size.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,448
Do we need to create
another subclass?

33
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:30,040
But hold your horses, you don't
need another subclass!

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,510
Oh.

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,180
Mr. Higgie says we don't
need another subclass.

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,230
And we don't.

37
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,470
We can create a UI View
Controller on the fly.

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,820
Let me show you what I mean.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,350
So inside our Favorites View
Controller, here's our show

40
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,120
zoomed picture method.

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Inside there, we're simply going
to create a new view

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,100
controller which is
not subclassed.

43
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,140
We're going to set the frame to
the entire view frame, set

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,210
the title, which will show
at the top of our view

45
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,810
controller.

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,030
Then we need the image.

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,830
So we create an image, just like
we did before, and add

48
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,210
that as a subview into our new
Image View Controller.

49
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,740
Finally, we grab our Navigation
Controller and push

50
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,360
onto our stack the new
Image View Controller

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
that we just created.

52
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,060
If we build and run our
application, here's what it

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,860
looks like.

54
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,970
So we start in the
FeedViewController, push to

55
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,960
the Favorites, and
then push to our

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,660
tryiosImageViewController,
just like that.

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,120
And it remembers which one is
previous in the stack so that

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,510
we can navigate back and
forth pretty easily.

59
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,910
So we know about the Tab Bar
Controller and about the

60
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,080
Navigation Controller, but
how might we use the

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,060
two at the same time?

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,460
Well, here we have our
basic profile view.

63
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,560
What we do is we wrap that
inside the Profile Navigation

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,310
Controller, which gives us
that bar at the top.

65
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,950
And then we're going to wrap
that inside the Tab Bar

66
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,050
Controller like you see here.

67
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,820
In our code, what is that
going to look like?

68
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,480
Well, first we have our Profile
View Controller.

69
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,380
We wrap that inside of our
Navigation Controller just

70
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,450
like we did a moment ago.

71
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,900
Then we'll create our window,
then instantiate our Tab Bar

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,870
Controller and set the View
Controllers for that to Tab

73
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,822
Bar Controller and set that Tab
Bar Controller as the root

74
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:12,880
view so it gets displayed.

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,150
So here's what it ends up
looking like with both the Tab

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,940
Bar and the Navigation
View Controllers.

77
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,240
Where did your other tabs go?

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,360
Oh, Mr. Higgie's right.

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,830
We lost our other tabs.

80
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,380
Well, maybe we'll leave that
you do in the challenges.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,367
