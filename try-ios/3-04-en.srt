00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
You probably noticed that the
tabs you're creating don't

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,420
have any icons.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,430
Well, let's add some icons.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,020
Icons are typically
30 by 30 points.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,640
They're usually PNG with just
the Alpha channel, and they're

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,260
usually just imported into
your XCode project.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,680
And you can just drag and
drop them inside.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,170
Then inside of your AppDelegate,
we can specify on

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,050
that feedViewController the
tabBar image, and we can send

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,000
in a UIImage.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,480
So here we actually just specify
the name of the file,

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,410
which in this case
is tab_icon_feed.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,740
And by default it's going
to look in the cache.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,890
If it doesn't find it
there, it's going to

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,820
look in the file system.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,710
And it will look for a
.PNG file by default.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,670
Go ahead and add the other
icons to the tabs.

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,920
I'll wait here.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,876
