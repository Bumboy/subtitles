1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,880
You're watching JavaScript,
The Return Flight.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,330
And this is level two, where
we're going to be using some

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,150
JavaScript to organize
our jQuery code.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,150
With all the code that we wrote
in level one, things are

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,370
starting to get messy in our
application.js file, and a

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,950
little disorganized.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,770
So in this level, we're going
to take a look at two

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,560
different ways we can organize
this code, starting with

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,562
refactoring it to use
JavaScript objects.

10
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:31,440
Here you can see, we have
a confirmation variable.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,600
Inside of that we have a
JavaScript object, which has

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,530
an Init key, which contains
a function.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,560
This is where we're going to put
all of our event handlers.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,130
Then when we want to call this
Init function, we place it

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,460
inside of our document
ready and simply call

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,910
confirmation Init.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,380
So every piece of functionality
that has to do

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,570
with confirmation is going
to get wrapped up in that

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,820
JavaScript object.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,850
So as I mentioned, inside of our
Init method we create our

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,160
event handlers.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,210
So here we have our click
handler for our button.

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,130
Inside of that it does
the Ajax call.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,040
And then here we have the

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,610
view-boarding-pass click handler.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,490
And these handlers get invoked
when the document is ready,

27
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,855
and it calls the confirmation
Init method.

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,180
There's one more step we can
take to organize our

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,860
JavaScript objects.

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,770
And that is to pull out the
call backs from our event

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,280
handlers, the functions
inside here.

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,990
So let's pull this out and
give it its own key.

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,330
We're going to call it
load confirmation.

34
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,050
And that's where we're going
to have our Ajax call.

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,230
Then above, in our confirmation
click handler,

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,420
we're simply going to pass
in that function, calling

37
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,160
this.loadConfirmation.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,520
We need to use this when we call
load confirmation because

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,640
we're referencing the current
object that we're inside.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,770
Now, we'll use the same
technique with the other click

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,810
handler and pull out that
function call back into its

42
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,650
own key, showBoardingPass.

43
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,180
Then we'll specify
this.showBoardingPass to send

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,730
in this function. Now, if we go
back in the web page, yep, it

45
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,700
still works.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,720
And this time our code
is much cleaner.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,870
Now, it's time for you to try
out a JavaScript object in the

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,120
challenges.
