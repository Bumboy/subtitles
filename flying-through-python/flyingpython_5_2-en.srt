00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,240
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,830
In this section, we'll be
creating our own module.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,690
As our spam van script
continues to grow,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,060
it's going to get really
hard to read and maintain.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,980
Right now this one script
is responsible for printing

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,990
the menu, taking
orders, sales reports,

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,040
and now accessing the
menu from the network.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,630
As our programs
get longer, we may

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,280
want to organize them
into several files

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,120
or separate modules
for easier maintenance.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,090
We can organize
our program better

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,860
by separating getting
customer orders,

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,930
accessing the menu
from the network,

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,060
and sales reports in
the separate modules.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,050
A script containing
definitions is a module

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,020
and can be imported by another
script or another module.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,970
And as long as these files
are in the same directory,

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,780
we can import them into
the spam van script

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,720
just by writing import
and the module name.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,209
We'll start with creating
the orders module now.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,140
First, we'll take all of
our definitions pertaining

22
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,350
to ordering and put them
in our orders module.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,400
Then the spam van script will
call the orders functions

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,300
from that module and
hold our main function.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
Now we have our separate files:
orders.py and spam_van.py,

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,530
but there's a little problem.

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,630
When we run spam van,
we get this error.

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,740
The reason is we forgot to
import the orders module.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,410
Import orders will be able
to find our orders model.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,760
But even still, if we run
this, it doesn't work.

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,670
We need to add orders dot

32
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,460
before each of
the functions that

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,930
are part of the orders module.

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,410
Now our program can
find the functions

35
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,680
within the orders module and
will run just as it did before.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,100
It prints out the menu,
gets the customer's order,

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,640
and prints out the bill total.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,010
That's it for Flying
through Python.

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,860
Good luck in the rest
of the challenges,

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,930
and I'll see you in
the wrap-up video.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
Sorry.

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,310
I couldn't remember
how to segue.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,550
Dictionary-o.

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,300
Dictionary-o?

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,280
Comparing.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,460
Creating from the--

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,670
We then put--

48
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,128
You're not going
to read your joke?

49
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:48,410
No.

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,740
Like, I tried.

51
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,390
It's not a good joke.

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,480
I, like, tried to come up with
stuff, and it was terrible.

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,220
Break a leg.
