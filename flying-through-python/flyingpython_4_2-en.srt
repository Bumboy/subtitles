00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,030
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,355
In this section, we'll
be reading from files.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,700
Every day, our boss sends us
a file of dollar menu items.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,780
We'd like to read
this file into a list.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,560
To read from a file, the
steps are similar to writing.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,400
First, we'll open the file.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,300
We use the open function with
the file name and the mode.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,740
Here it's R for read.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,340
Second, we read from the file.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,040
The dollar spam.read will read
the entire file's contents.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,020
Finally, we close the file
with dollar spam.close.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,510
There's a few other ways
to read from a file instead

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,430
of reading the entire
file's contents at once.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,680
Read line will allow you
to read one line at a time

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,180
by looking for a
new line character,

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,020
and it will keep track
of what line we're on.

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,080
You can also read
all of the lines

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,130
individually in a loop, which
will be convenient for reading

19
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,860
all of the lines into our list.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,450
But before we do
this, let's write code

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,080
to print out each
line of our file.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,510
We'll do this by
using a for loop

23
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,050
and write for line
in dollar spam

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,370
and then print out the line.

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,870
Great.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,080
Printing works.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,650
Now let's try reading
each of these lines

28
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,520
into a list called dollar menu.

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,710
So we create our variable
dollar menu as an empty list.

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,390
And then inside our for loop,
we append each line of our file

31
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,670
to our dollar menu list.

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,200
And then after the loop,
we print our dollar menu

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,260
and finally close
our dollar spam file.

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,010
This was perfect for reading
each line into a list.

35
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,990
The only problem is we also
read in the new line characters.

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,415
We'll want to fix this by
getting rid of the new lines.

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,510
If we use the
string method strip,

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,630
this will return
a string with all

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,170
of the leading and trailing
white space removed,

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,160
and white space includes
new line characters.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,330
And there you have it.

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,030
We've successfully read in our
dollar menu file into a list.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,940
Now it's time for you
to practice reading

44
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,870
from files and the challenges.

45
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,538
Good luck.
