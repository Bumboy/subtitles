00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,350
Welcome back to
Flying Through Python.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,200
In this section, we'll be
comparing and combining

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,310
lists and dictionaries.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,720
Just like we can compare strings
and numbers for equality,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,640
we can also check if
two lists are equal.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,220
For two lists to
be equal, they have

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,790
to have exactly the same items
in exactly the same order.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,320
So if my list has one,
two, three, four, in order.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,350
And your list is reversed,
checking if the two

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,260
lists are equal returns false.

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,630
If we add another list,
his list, with the same

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,820
ordered one, two, three, four,
and then check for equality

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,470
with my list, we get true.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,540


16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,800
But how does this work for
comparing dictionaries?

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,490
We created a simple dictionary
here with the key and value

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,590
as the same numbers for
numbers one through four.

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,450
Then we created the same
dictionary in reverse order.

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,110
Since order doesn't
matter in dictionaries,

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,950
the dictionaries
are actually equal.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,100
If this bothers you, think
about looking up the key one.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,630
Would you get the same value?

24
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,500
Yes, you would.

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,750
You'd still get the value one.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,030
Let's say we have three
different menu lists,

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,110
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

28
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,140
How would we combine
these into one list?

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,420


30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,350
A list is a container
of anything you want,

31
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,330
so you can even have
a list of lists.

32
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,500
Let's say for our
food truck, we want

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,570
a list of menus, the breakfast,
lunch, and dinner menus.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,530
And each menu stores
a list of food items.

35
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,450
Then, if we print the
menu at index zero,

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,550
we get the breakfast menu.

37
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,270
Index one returns
the lunch menu.

38
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,530
And index two returns
the dinner menu.

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,410
A list of lists is sometimes
called a two dimensional list.

40
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,220
So how would we get an element
from one of these inner lists?

41
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,410
Like spam and jam.

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,750
First, we need to access
the inner list which

43
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,010
we can do by writing menus,
square bracket, zero.

44
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,680
So now that we have
that list, we just

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,000
need to get that second
item, spam and jam.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,270
And we do that by using
index one in the inner list.

47
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,460
So menus, zero, one,
gives us spam and jam.

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,440
We could make this
code even better

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,290
if we didn't have to just know
that the breakfast menu was

50
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,300
at index zero, the lunch
menu was at index one,

51
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,820
and the dinner menu
was at index two.

52
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,630
We could use a dictionary
where the key breakfast has

53
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,770
the value of the list
of breakfast items,

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,720
the key lunch has the value
of the list of lunch items,

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,850
and the key dinner has the value
of the list of dinner items.

56
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,840
That makes it much
easier to find each menu.

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,620


58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,150
Now that you've seen
comparing and combining

59
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,300
lists and dictionaries,
it's time for you

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,830
to give it a try
in the challenges.

61
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,500
Good luck.

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,824
