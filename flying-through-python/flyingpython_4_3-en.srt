00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,950
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,190
In this section, we'll
be covering exceptions.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,730
If we try to open a
file that doesn't exist,

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,150
we get a File Not Found Error.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,960
It would be great if we could
recover from this type of error

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,160
and continue with our program.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,030
Try, except allows
us to do just that.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,840
Anything we put in the try
block is potentially error prone

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,730
code, like opening a file.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,240
It's like we're
saying, try this.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,210
And if you get an error,
print the error message

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,030
in the except block.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,965
And then continue with
the program as usual.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,610
Python has over 60
types of exceptions.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,490
Here's some of the
ones we've seen before.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:57,180
Exceptions like file not found
error, index error, key error,

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,140
name error, and value error.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,055
Let's look specifically at
handling this value error next.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,790
A value error can
occur when we try

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,050
to convert a string to a
number and the string actually

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,160
contains a word
instead of a number.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,830
Like here we're asking the
user to enter the price.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,210
Since we know the specific
situation can cause a value

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,080
error, we're specifically
checking for a value error.

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,540
If the user enters
a number, the price

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,240
is printed out as expected.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,360
If the user doesn't
enter a number,

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,780
like here, the word
oops, our error message,

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,210
not a number is printed.

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,090
Instead of creating a
custom error message,

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,320
we can capture the
error as a variable

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,460
and print it inside
the except block.

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,920
So here, the user enters yo.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,890
And we get the error could not
convert string to float yo.

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,570
That's it for Level 4.

36
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,970
Now it's trime
for-- time for you--

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,630
OK, that's it for level 4.

38
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,390
Now it's time for
you to practice

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,780
try except in the challenges.

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,590
Have fun.
