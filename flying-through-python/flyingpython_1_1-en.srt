00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,510
[SINGING] Cheerio pip pip,
let's code some Python files.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,430
We'll use quick lists, and
loops with fors and whiles.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,390
Use modules we can, with
functions write them on.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:20,550
Come join the Spam Van
and fly through Python.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,380
Welcome to Flying
Through Python.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm Sarah Buchanan.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,490
And in this course, we'll be
building upon the basics taught

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,010
in Try Python.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,890
And learning more about the
language's core constructs.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,270
Lists, dictionaries, loops,
functions, and modules.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,120
At the end of this
course, we want

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,690
to build a basic
point of sale system

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,170
for our circus food
truck, the Spam Van.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,760
And to do that,
we'll want to start

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,610
with a list of British
slang to inspire our menu.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,025
Let's get started with
lists and dictionaries.

17
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,330
Lists in Python are containers
that can store any type of data

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,760
that you want.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
We can create an empty
list with square brackets

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,010
and add things later, or
we can initialize our lists

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,580
with some values
separated by commas.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,600
Such as a list of numbers,
a list of strings, or you

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,980
can even have a
mixed list of items.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,220
If you remember the string
level from Try Python,

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,470
we've actually already
seen lists before.

26
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,300
Just like a string is a list of
characters starting from zero,

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,140
list are ordered lists starting
with position or index zero.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,530
And you can get
each item in a list

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,840
with its index using
square brackets.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,150
Here we have a list of strings.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,210
So if we look up the string
at index zero, we get cheers.

32
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,380
And the string
index three is hiya.

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,790
We can also slice
a list to get a sub

34
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,420
list in the same way we slice
a string to get a substring.

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,110
So the slice from one to three
gives us cheerio and watcha.

36
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,540
Now that we know how
to create a list,

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,390
let's create a list
of British sayings

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,960
to inspire our Spam Van menu.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,320
We can create the list
with elements in it

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,140
already or create an empty list.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,030
And we can add more
items as we need them.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,470
We add an item to
the end of our list

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,480
by typing the name of the list,
slang.append and then the item

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,260
we want to append
in parentheses.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,780
Here, the string cheeky.

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,380
And we'll also add yonks.

47
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,470
And we end up with the
following list of five strings:

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,490
Cheerio, pip pip, smashing,
cheeky, and yonks.

49
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,450
We can remove items from
our list in two ways.

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,870
If we know the item
we want to remove,

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,420
we use the remove
method in the same way

52
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,260
we use the append method.

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,390
With the list name,
slang.remove, and the item

54
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,900
cheeky in parentheses.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,160
If we don't know the exact
item but we know the position,

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,950
we can use del --
short for delete --

57
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,140
followed by the list's name,
square brackets, and the index.

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,640
If we had used either
one of these statements,

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,130
we end up with the
resulting list:

60
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,430
Cheerio, pip pip,
smashing, yonks.

61
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,570
We can also delete a slice,
or a section of our list,

62
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,890
by using del followed
by the slice.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,100
Here we deleted the
first two items,

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,520
and end up with the
list: smashing, yonks.

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,270
Now it's time for
you to practice

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,170
with lists in the challenges.

67
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,810
Good luck.
