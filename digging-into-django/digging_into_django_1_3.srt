00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,470
Welcome back to
level 1, section 3

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,720
where we'll be covering
template inheritance.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,890
Each page on our site
will have repeated code

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,820
for at least the navbar,
the header, and the footer.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,230
It would be great if we could
share this repeated code

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,853
across different templates.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,260
To do this, we can
create a base template

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,030
that will hold the repeated
code for the navbar

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,025
and footer that other
templates can then extend.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,440
In this base template, we'll
start by loading static files.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,030
Then we'll have
all of the repeated

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,450
code for in the
navbar, and then we'll

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,400
create this block that
we'll assign a name to.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,410
We'll call ours block content.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,620
This is a special
template tag that's

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,020
a placeholder for all
of the content from all

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,080
of our other templates.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,330
So we're actually not
going to fill this block

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,750
in with any code.

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,510
Then in index.html, we'll start
by extending the base template.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,670
And then we'll write
all of the code that's

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,445
specific to the index page.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,420
And that will be wrapped
by this block tag that

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,010
will tell Django to
put all of this code

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,376
where it belongs in
the base template.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,520
So the final rendered
index template

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,150
will have all of the navbar,
then the copied in index code,

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,924
and then the footer
combined into one template.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,170
So what's the
actual code we would

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,574
put in our base.html template?

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
We start with loading
the static files.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,910
Then we put in our head tags
and we load our CSS files.

33
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,380
We'll add our navbar.

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,810
And we can even put
in the main tags

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,690
that will contain the block
content from each template.

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,780
And then finally,
we'll add our footer.

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,145
Then in index.html,
we'll extend base.

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,170
And then inside of
our block content,

39
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,225
we'll add all of the code
for displaying our treasures.

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,310
The detail template
will look very similar,

41
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,060
except it will have code
specific to the detail

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,420
page for displaying
a single treasure.

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,560
If we look at this in
action, nothing has changed.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,280
But behind the scenes, our
code is more organized.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,050
So if we change something
in the navbar, for instance,

46
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,115
we only have to change it
in one place, in the base.

47
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,050
Now it's time for you to
organize your templates

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,310
in the challenges.

49
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,130
Good luck.
