1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,050
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,615
In this section, we'll
be adding a detail page.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,630
Now that our home
page is displaying

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,590
a grid of just images,
we'd like to be

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,860
able to click on
one of those images,

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,800
and be brought to
the detail page

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,902
to show more details
about our treasures.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,160
The URL for the
detail page will be

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,620
localhost/id of the
treasure we're displaying.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,800
For example, here
we have localhost/15

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,840
which is the id of the
golden monkey displayed.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,720
For the new detail
page we'll need

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,690
to create this new
URL in urls.py.

14
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,080
Create a detail
view in views.py.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,772
And create a
detail.html template.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,620
We'll start by adding
our details URL.

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,560
This URL will capture any
number, save that number,

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,330
and then send it
to the detail view.

19
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,060
This regular expression
is a little more complex

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,900
than the one we saw before.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,220
So let's break it down.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,790
In our existing index URL,
we're not checking for any path.

23
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,220
Which means, it would
just match local host.

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,770
But now we want to
capture a number.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,770
And how we do that
is with square

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,020
brackets 0 through 9 plus.

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,390
And that will match any number.

28
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,150
So then we just add
parenthesis and that

29
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,940
will capture that number, which
means it will then be passed

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,980
as a parameter to the detail view.

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,360
For instance, localhost/0.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,020
That 0 would be captured, and
then passed to the detail view

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,380
as a parameter.

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,060
We're going to show
you all the regex

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,280
you need to create this app, and
to go through the challenges.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,810
But if you're really
interested in knowing more,

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,740
you can check out
our Breaking the Ice

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,496
with Regular Expressions course.

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,510
So we said that this number
would be captured by the URL

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,460
and passed to the detail view.

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,120
So when we create
our detail view,

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
we'll have two parameters.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,650
Request and then whatever
we name that number,

44
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,890
and we're going to
call it treasure ID.

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,140
Now we want to get the treasure
that corresponds to that ID.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,710
So we can do
treasure.objects.get

47
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,910
and then check if that ID
is equal to treasure ID.

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,760
You may be wondering
where this ID

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,488
field came from in the model.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,640
Because if we look at our
model, there is no ID field.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,975
So how did we look up
a treasure by its ID?

52
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,790
By default, Django
automatically provides us

53
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,160
with an auto-incrementing
primary key field.

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,870
That means we can look up a
specific treasure with this ID

55
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,956
field, and every treasure is
guaranteed to have a unique ID.

56
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,470
Back in the detail view,
we can pass the template

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,694
the treasure we just looked up.

58
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,430
Now that we have the
URL and view set up,

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,350
the last step is to put
together our template.

60
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,780
This is a new template
called detail.html.

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,550
And because we passed
in the treasure object,

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,890
we can access all of its fields,
like name, image URL, value,

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,250
and location.

64
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,670
We haven't added any style yet
just to see that it's working.

65
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,330
To add some style
to our page we'll

66
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,310
basically copy the same styles
we added to the home page,

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,720
but we don't need a for
loop because we're only

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,460
displaying one single treasure.

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,590
I know we've added a lot
of HTML and CSS here,

70
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,550
but it's specific to the design
we've created for our page.

71
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,520
And you don't have to
memorize it or anything

72
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,347
because each app you create
will have its own HTML and CSS

73
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:16,847
elements.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,150
So now we have all of the pieces
to our detail view in place.

75
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,040
The URL, the view, and
the detail template.

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,050
But we're missing one part.

77
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,340
We need a link
from the home page

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,738
to get to the detail
page of each treasure.

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,060
We can do this by wrapping the
entire panel in an anchor tag

80
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,510
that links to /treasure.id.

81
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,100
That way if you click
anywhere on the panel,

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,102
you'll be taken to that
treasures detail page.

83
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,900
Now we can see this
in action by clicking

84
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,410
on a treasure on the home
page, and being taken

85
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,276
to that treasures detail page.

86
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,930
Now it's time for you to
create your own detail

87
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,780
page in the challenges.

88
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,338
Good luck.
