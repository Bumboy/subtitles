00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,180
[SINGING] Deep within the jungle
lie treasures most unknown.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,060
To track what we uncover,
we'll need to use Django.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:18,260
AJAX, forms, and grids,
we'll cross the pyramids.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,660
Dust off your old durangos -

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,640
we're Digging Into Django.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,160
Welcome back to
Digging Into Django.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,200
This is level three, where
we'll be covering adding

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,125
the ability to upload images.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,580
Users can now add
treasures through the form

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,120
we created in level
two, but they still

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,000
need to have an image URL of
where their image is hosted,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,490
and we'd like them to be able
to upload an image directly

13
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,165
into the app.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,930
To do this we'll want
to use an image field,

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,210
and there's a few steps
to getting that working.

16
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,350
First we'll add the
image field to our model,

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,680
then we'll need to install
Pillow to use that image field.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,010
Then we'll migrate our
changes to the database.

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,400
We'll update settings.py
to add a media directory,

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,370
and finally, add a special URL
to urls.py to serve our media

21
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,910
files locally.

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,400
So let's do each of
these steps in order.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,770
First, in our treasure model
we'll get rid of image URL,

24
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,040
and we'll add our new
image field, which

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,710
has two required parameters.

26
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,010
Upload two is the location
inside of the media directory

27
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,150
where we'll add our
images to, and default

28
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,940
is a default image in case
the user doesn't upload one.

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,680
So since we just
changed the model,

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,120
you'd think we'd want to
run make migrations.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,840
But if we try to do
that, we get this error

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,460
that Pillow's not installed,
and we get some information

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,780
on how to install it.

34
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,010
We can install Pillow
with pip install Pillow.

35
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,910
This will download it
and install it for us.

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,940
Now that Pillow's
installed, we can

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,040
run python manage.py
make migrations,

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,840
which will add our image field.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,100
Then we can run python
manage.py migrate,

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,715
which will finish migrating
your changes to the database.

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,220
At the bottom of
settings.py we'll

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,540
add this media
root variable that

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,050
will tell us the location
of where to store all

44
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,610
of these user uploaded files.

45
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,540
So all our images will go
in that media directory.

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,725
And media URL handles serving
the media from media root.

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,470
Because we're running
our app locally,

48
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,630
we need to add this special
URL to our urls.py file.

49
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,710
This will match any
image in media slash,

50
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,470
and will serve that file
locally from the media root

51
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,910
directory we just created.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,340
Now we've finished all the
steps to set up an image field,

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,090
but we still need to refactor
a few things to replace

54
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,600
our old image URL with
our new image field,

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,265
in forms.py views.py, and
both of our templates.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,180
In forms.py we'll just
replace our image URL

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,000
with our new image.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
And remember, since we declared
that image field in our model,

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,120
it will pull over all of
the associated properties,

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,390
and the fact that
it's an image field.

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,700
So now in our post
treasure view,

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,816
we'll also need to pass our
request.files to our form.

63
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,070
Finally, in our
index template we

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,860
can change that ENC
type to multipart form

65
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,830
data, which is required
when submitting files

66
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,350
through a form.

67
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,600
And then in both our index
and detail templates,

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,380
we'll need to change the old
treasure.image URL to our new

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,401
treasure.image, and then add
.url to get that images URL

70
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:40,900
field.

71
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,180
So now our image
field is ready to use,

72
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,780
and we can see that we
can create a new treasure

73
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,640
and upload a
corresponding image,

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,878
and then we can see that
new treasure displayed.

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,410
Now it's time for you
to do some challenges.

76
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,100
I'll see you in the next level.
