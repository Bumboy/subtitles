00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,582
Welcome back to Level
5, Section 2.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,280
Remember how in Level 2
we said that a GET should

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,460
be used when we want to
retrieve data from the server,

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,670
but a POST should be used
when we want to send data

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,230
to be saved to the database?

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,510
Well, we'll want to change
our AJAX to use a POST.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,560
We'll want to use a
POST because we're

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,570
updating the treasure with
the new number of likes

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,330
in the database.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,590
So there's just a few
changes we need to make

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,615
to change our GET to a POST.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,890
In our main.js
file we'll change the request

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,985
type to a POST.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,640
In our view, we'll
also change request dot

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,420
GET to request dot POST.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,000
But now if we try
to run this, we

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,280
see that we get an error because
a Django POST needs a CSRF

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,080
token.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,670
But since we're doing
the POST through AJAX,

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,090
we can't just put the CSRF token
in the form like we did before.

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,290
So if you remember
from Level 2, we

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,840
had a form POST with a CSRF
token added in the template.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,170
For AJAX, we can look up the
CSRF token in the user session

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,650
cookie and then add
that to the POST header.

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,740
The code to do this
is kind of crazy,

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,170
but luckily Django
provides this code for you

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,070
on their docs website.

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,830
So we're going to look at it
so we can see how it's working,

29
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,720
but we're not going to
go into great detail.

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,785
The first function
we find in the docs

31
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:55,080
is this get Cookie function
that will take in a string

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,550
and look up the
corresponding cookie.

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,280
And we can see we use
this below by creating

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,070
a CSRF token variable that
will store the cookie returned

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,918
by this function.

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,610
So we want to add this CSRF
token to every AJAX POST

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,680
request.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,920
So we're going to use this
AJAX setup function that

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,800
takes in a before send function
that will append the CSRF

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
token to the request header.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,925
This before send function will
run with every AJAX request.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,840
Now we can see our like button
is working exactly the same

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,150
as it did before, but
we're using a POST request

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,288
like we should be.

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,950
Congrats on making it to the
end of Digging Into Django.

46
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,280
Good luck on the final
set of challenges,

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,940
and I'll see you in the
final wrap up video.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,900
It's just going to give our
page a nice look and feel,

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,230
and that's why we added it--sorry

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,730
We're going to send
data that's going

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,080
to change stuff on the database--

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,785
Notice we don't have to create
any of these car fields.

53
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,510
Notice we don't do have
to do any of that crap.

54
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,640
Now we can see our
form is working exactly

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,250
as it was beform-- beform?

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,500
So it's proddy-- sorry, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,390
I can't talk anymore.

58
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,917
Good luck with stuff
in the challenges.
