00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,600
Welcome back to level
2, section 2

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,570
where we'll look at creating
our forms in a smarter way using

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,740
Meta classes.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,530
We'll end up with
a form that has

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,490
the exact same
functionality as before,

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,022
but with a lot less code.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,540
If we compare to our
original form code,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,180
there will be a few differences.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,930
First, we'll need to
import our treasure model

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,170
since we'll be referencing it.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,210
And our treasure
form class will now

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,970
inherit from
forms.ModelForm, which

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,620
is the first step to
linking a form with a model.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,980
Notice we don't have to
create any of the fields

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,890
as we did before.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,610
Instead, we'll just use
this class called Meta.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,390
The name of this class
will always be Meta,

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,010
and we'll use it to
link our new form

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,710
to our already created model.

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,150
Inside the class we'll
specify that our model

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,335
will be Treasure.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,450
And the fields will be a list
of all of the model fields

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,420
we want to show up on our form.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,680
Now that we've changed our
form to be a model form,

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,190
we'll go and update our view.

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,380
We can replace all of the code
we had before for manually

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,049
creating a treasure and
saving it with this one line,

28
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,090
form.save(commit = True).

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,490
And in this single step,
we're reading all of the data

30
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,230
from the form fields and
saving it to the database.

31
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,890
Even though we're
doing save on the form,

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,730
this is actually creating
a treasure object for us

33
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,940
because the form is linked
to the treasure model.

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,600
Afterwards we'll still
redirect to the home page.

35
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,810
Now you can see that our
form is working exactly

36
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,146
as it was before, but
with a lot less form code.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Now it's time for
you to practice

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,130
with ModelForms and Meta
classes in the challenges.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,810
Good luck.
