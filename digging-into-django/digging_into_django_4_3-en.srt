00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome back to level
four, section three.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,260
We're almost done with
user authentication,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,270
but we'll also want to add
the ability to log out,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,778
and links for logging
in and logging out.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,050
To add log out
functionality, we'll

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,390
just need a URL and
view, but not a template.

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,670
The log out URL is pretty
similar to the log in URL,

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,380
except named logout.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,550
In our log out view, we'll
use the built in log out

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,810
function that takes
in the request,

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,780
and then we'll simply redirect
back to the home page.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,580
But right now if we
go to our home page,

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,150
we don't have any links set
up to log in or log out,

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,530
so we'll want to add those.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,000
Since we want those to
show up on every page,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,650
the best place to add those
is in our base.html template.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,469
And we'll add those right after
we display the Treasuregram

18
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:03,969
logo.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,120
So we only want to show a
log in link if we're not

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,060
actually logged in, and
then if we are logged in,

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,000
we want to show a log out link,
and a link to our profile.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,030
And we can accomplish this
with a big if else block.

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,160
If the user is
authenticated, we'll

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,130
show the link to their profile
and a link to log out.

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,670
Otherwise we'll just
add a link to log in.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,190
Before we were hard coding
any links in our templates,

27
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,240
but there's a
better way to do it.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,885
You can use a URL template tag.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,770
And you can do that by writing
URL, the name of the URL,

30
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,210
and any parameters you
want to pass to that URL.

31
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,450
So here we have the profile
as the name of the URL,

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,950
and user.username that
we want to pass there.

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,664
So if my username is Sarah,
the URL will look like this.

34
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,540
Then we can add the links
to log in and log out

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,895
with the same URL tag, except
they don't need any parameters.

36
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,980
And we can also
add a little style

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,153
by adding our CSS classes.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,285
Now we can see our log in and
log out process in action.

39
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,340
And that's it for level
four, section three.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,510
Good luck in the challenges.
