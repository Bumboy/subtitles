1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,330
[SINGING] It's time
to build an app,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,350
to a framework I will go.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,220
Ambitious apps are easy
when Ember runs the show.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,610
Templates, Routes, and
Models, it's a client MVC.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,666
Best practices from all around;

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,280
come try Ember with me.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,070
Welcome to Try Ember.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm Nathaniel Bibler.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,822
In this first level, I'm going
to introduce you to Ember.

10
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,530
I'm going to show you
what it's used for.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm going to show
you who uses it.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,090
I'm going to show you
some apps that we're

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,860
going to build together
with it, and then I'm

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,660
going to show you how to
get it installed and get up

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,160
and running.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,080
To get up and
running with Ember,

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,290
it's important that you
know HTML and JavaScript.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,320
If you're not super
comfortable JavaScript,

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,300
you can go to something
like Try JavaScript

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,014
on JavaScript.com or Code
School's JavaScript Road Trip.

21
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,680
It's not as important
that you know back

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,270
end software, like
Ruby or Python,

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,530
or even database systems,
like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,240
And finally, while you will
need to have Node.js installed

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,070
and running, you don't need
a whole lot of experience

26
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,569
with it, and we'll
actually show you

27
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,400
where to go for instructions
on how to install that.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,180
With that out of the
way, what is Ember?

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,540
Ember is an open
source MVC framework

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,360
for creating ambitious
web applications.

31
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,130
And I know that
sounds like a lot,

32
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,050
and I'll break it
down just a minute.

33
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,000
But first, let's
see who's using it.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,900
The most immediate and
obvious answer is Discourse.

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,700
Discourse is an open source
and very popular forum system.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,240
In fact, both Code
School's and Ember's forum

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,980
are powered by Discourse.

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,070
Ember has also moved beyond just
powering open source systems

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,800
to now powering
small businesses,

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,557
like Dollar Shave Club.

41
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:43,140
Or maybe that one's
too small for you.

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,740
So how about Sony?

43
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,240
Ember powers PlayStation Now.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,040
Even Apple is using Ember.

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,310
In fact, Ember came out
of an Apple project called

46
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,820
SproutCore, and Apple now uses
Ember to power its help guides.

47
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,670
And then there's also
Apple Music Store

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,380
that's now powered by Ember.

49
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,930
And finally, if those two
are large enough for you,

50
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,130
we've also got NASA.gov.

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,790
Now back to Ember and MVC.

52
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,210
You've probably heard of
Model View Controller, or MVC

53
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,530
architectures, before.

54
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,670
Most server side frameworks
and even client side frameworks

55
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,420
follow these patterns
to varying degrees.

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,700
At a high level, your user will
interact with a controller.

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,720
That controller will in turn
manipulate data on a model.

58
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,560
That model's data
will change and update

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,510
a presentation or view layer,
which your user will finally

60
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,470
see.

61
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,530
The separation of
responsibilities

62
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,220
makes it easier to maintain
and work with the code

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,900
as well as distribute that code
to larger teams and everybody

64
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,230
work together at the same time.

65
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,330
Now, what about
that ambitious part?

66
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,140
Well, in traditional
web applications,

67
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,490
whenever a user interacts
with your website,

68
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,650
they might click on a
link or submit a form.

69
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,160
That data gets transmitted
back to the server.

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,260
The server then verifies it
and works with it and renders

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,340
some new output, which then
ships back over to the client.

72
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,250
That whole process takes
quite a bit of time,

73
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,560
especially on the network side.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,430
To combat some of
those inefficiencies

75
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,030
and make your application
feel more responsive,

76
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,340
the web is actually
well into a shift

77
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,722
of putting more of that
responsibility onto the client.

78
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:15,180
So where before, the server
was doing a lot of these things

79
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,200
and there was a network
request involved,

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,590
those responsibilities, like
validation and rendering,

81
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,140
are shifting onto the client
and cutting out that network

82
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,180
request almost entirely.

83
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,550
Whereas some frameworks only
focus on one or two things,

84
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,930
Ember's philosophy is to be
a lot more all encompassing.

85
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,290
So Ember packages up all of your
build tools and best practices

86
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,560
and standards into
one place that

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
benefits from the
knowledge of everybody.

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,780
And that even extends to having
Ember core team members working

89
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,400
on web standards with a W3C.

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,550
Ember's ambitious goal is
to capture all the best

91
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,510
practices in the community,
framework and non-framework,

92
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,760
and boil them down into
straightforward, common

93
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,200
convention that all of us can
use, Ember developers or not.

94
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,770
In this course, we're both
going to work on apps.

95
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,990
I'm going to walk you through
building a camp supply

96
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,650
store for the Woodland
Wanderer Whatchamacallits.

97
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,800
There, the campers
can view a menu.

98
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,082
They can place an order,
and they can get a receipt.

99
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,040
And you are going to make
sure the critters are

100
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,320
learning what they need by
building a camper polling

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,269
system.

102
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,810
In it, campers can
create polling questions,

103
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,370
answer those poll questions,
and view the poll results.

104
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,110
Now that you know what Ember
is, let's get it installed.

105
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,910
The official way to create
an Ember application

106
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,390
is by using something
called Ember CLI.

107
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,340
Ember CLI is a Node.js
package, so it's

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,220
going to be installed
through Node's NPM.

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,010
Just in case you don't already
have Node.js or the NPM Package

110
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,910
Manager installed,
you should check out

111
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,930
Nodejs.org for setup and
installation instructions

112
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,985
in your environment.

113
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,360
There are downloadable
installers

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,680
available for Windows,
Mac OS, Linux, and more.

115
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,140
Once Node and NPM are
installed, Ember CLI

116
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,250
is installed by typing
NPM install-g Ember CLI.

117
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,450
Ember CLI is the name
of the NPM package,

118
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,750
and that -g install
Ember CLI globally.

119
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,575
What that does is it
makes the executable

120
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:20,000
that it installs available
to every user on your system.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,420
Once Ember CLI installs, it
will install an Ember executable

122
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,552
on your system.

123
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,510
You can see here that
when I run Ember version,

124
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,760
it tells me the current
version of Ember CLI installed.

125
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,570
It's important to note here
that it's an Ember executable,

126
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,067
not Ember-CLI, which I know
is a little bit confusing.

127
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,900
But we are going to be
using this executable

128
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,830
throughout this course, so it's
important to know about it.

129
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,130
The Ember Command Line
Interface, or CLI,

130
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,950
is where you're going to be
spending a lot of your time

131
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,170
if you're building
an Ember application.

132
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,700
Ember CLI provides a ton
of features and support,

133
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,640
helpers, and generators
for doing everyday tasks.

134
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,350
At any time, you
can run Ember Help

135
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,340
to get an idea of what
commands are available

136
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,320
or Ember Help and a
command name for details

137
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,392
about a single command.

138
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,100
So let's get started
by creating an Ember

139
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,270
application using Ember CLI.

140
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,300
To do that, we'll type
Ember new project name.

141
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,600
And that will instruct
Ember CLI to run a blueprint

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,200
to generate a whole directory
for us for the project.

143
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,620
Here you can see when we type
Ember New Woodland-- Woodland

144
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,330
because that's the
name of our project--

145
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,290
Ember CLI creates a bunch
of new files and directories

146
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,660
to get us going.

147
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,330
Once the project is created,
we can change directories

148
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,190
into our project
directory was created,

149
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,310
and we can type Ember serve.

150
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,360
What that does is it starts
up a development server that

151
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,390
has live reloading
functionality, which

152
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,780
means whenever we change
any file in the application,

153
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,720
it automatically reloads
our browsers for us.

154
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,680
And now we can open a browser,
go to local host 4200,

155
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,350
and see a welcome
to Ember message.

156
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,410
With that, we've
got Ember installed.

157
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,924
Now, I know that you're eager
to start your development.

158
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,590
But first, we need
to make sure that you

159
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,310
know what you need to know and
get your own project started.

160
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,900
So head on over and
do the challenges,

161
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,270
and I'll see you
in the next level.
