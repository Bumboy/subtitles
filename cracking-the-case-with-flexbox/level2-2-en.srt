00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,610
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,623
This is Level 2, Section
2, Order in the Flexbox,

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:08,039
where we're talking
about changing

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,748
the order of items with CSS.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,790
There are times in
layout where you

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,580
want items to display
in a different order

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,230
than their source order.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,930
This can be done with
standard layout techniques,

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,760
but it's a little
hacky-- you might

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,910
use negative margins
or absolute positioning

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,520
to achieve something
like you see here.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,455
However, Flexbox
makes it super simple.

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,830
The order property is used to
determine the order of flex

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,080
items along the main axis.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,760
It defaults to 0, and it accepts
positive and negative numbers.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,750
Here, by default, each
flex item in our container

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,642
has an order of 0, so they
display in their source order.

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,320
Here, we're taking an element
with the class of nav-clues

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
and assigning a negative 1
value to its order property.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,250
That makes it display
before all of the items

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,735
with their default order, 0.

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,610
In column direction,
this works the same way,

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,330
except that the order is going
to adjust things vertically.

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,490
Here, if we take the paragraph
with a class of slogan,

25
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,920
change the order
to a positive 1,

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,340
that's going to make it
display after all of the items

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,588
with the order of 0.

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,370
Now you can use Flexbox to
change the order of elements

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,130
in the challenges.
