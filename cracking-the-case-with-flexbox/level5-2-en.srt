1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,700
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,797
This is Level 5, Section
2, Scary Shorthand.

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,630
And we're going to be
talking about grouping

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,955
multiple properties
into a single property.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,330
The flex shorthand property
is used to set values for

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,840
flex-grow, flex-shrink,
and flex-basis.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,060
It defaults to 0 1 auto based
on the defaults of the grow,

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,250
shrink, and basis properties.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,360
Before we go any further with
these, the one thing I will say

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,250
is if you have to
support older IE,

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,420
you may want to avoid shorthand.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,730
It's where you'll see
the most inconsistencies

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,260
among the browsers.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,910
In using shorthand,
you're not always

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,390
going to want to set
all three values.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,430
If you see flex with a
single numerical value,

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,950
that's declaring the
flex-grow property

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,690
and leaving the defaults for
flex-shrink and flex-basis.

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,670
If you see flex with
two numerical values,

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,180
that's setting the flex-grow
and flex-shrink properties

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,820
and leaving flex-basis
to its default.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,180
If you see flex with a
single numerical value

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,610
and a measurement-- like
pixels or percentages--

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,050
that is assigning the
flex-grow and the flex-basis

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,830
and leaving shrink
to its default.

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,120
And finally, if you
see a flex with none,

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,770
that's going to set
the flex-shrink to 0

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,040
and leave the others as default,
thereby treating the item

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,856
like it's not a
flex item at all.

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,570
The flex-flow
shorthand property is

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,560
used to set values for
flex-direction and flex-wrap.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,060
The default is row nowrap
based on the direction and wrap

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,560
properties.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,310
Much like the flex
shorthand, you

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,420
will see these
with single values.

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,500
And if you see flex-flow
with just column,

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,940
that's setting the direction
and leaving wrap to its default.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,810
If you see it with
just a value of wrap,

39
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,670
that setting the flex-wrap value
and leaving the flex-direction

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,890
to its default.

41
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,021
Congratulations on reaching
the end of the course.

42
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,020
To wrap things up, you're
going to use shorthand

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,400
in the challenges, and then I'll
see you in the wrap-up video.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,900
[BEEP]

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,730
Be happy for them.

46
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,229
Oh, gotcha.

47
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,502
[LAUGHTER]

48
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,736
Just go do it.

49
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:21,236
[BEEP]

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,400
Everything's new.

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,590
That's why we're here.

52
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,470
[LAUGHTER]

53
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,650
On the cross actious-- actious.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,300
Actious Jackson.

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,995
Welcome back-- nope.

56
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:35,957
[LAUGHTER]

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,240
But in order to--

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,090
