00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,580
jQuery will help you build your
dotcom, find an element

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,430
inside of the DOM, AJAX
traversal manipulation, event

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,590
handling, and animation
providing you with

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:21,650
versatility, an API with
extensibility.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,130
jQuery is something
you can't ignore.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,600
Write less.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,850
Do more.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,400
You're watching Try jQuery,
and this is level four.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,770
In this section, we're going to
be going over this web page

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,990
you see here.

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,510
We've got one vacation,
and we want to look

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,380
at the flight details.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,960
So we'll click the Flight
Details button, and it'll give

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,200
us more information
about that flight.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,500
So how might we implement
that?

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,680
Well, let's take a look
inside the HTML first.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,170
Here is our confirmation
list item.

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,530
Inside of that, we have a button
labeled flight details.

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,990
And then we have an unordered
list, which has those extra

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,140
details, which get shown when
we click the button.

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,760
So clicking this button will
show the ticket here.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,980
To set this up, we're first
going to set a CSS style on

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,600
the ticket class to display
none, so that it starts out as

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,890
hidden when we first
load the page.

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,420
There's three steps to
making this work.

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,760
First, we're going to watch
for the click event, then

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,190
we're going to find the ticket,
and then show it.

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,030
First thing we need to do is
write our event handler.

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,030
We'll grab the confirmation
li.

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,770
And then when there's a button
inside of that which gets

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,590
clicked, we're going
to run some code.

33
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,800
In our case, we want
to grab the button.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,180
We're going to search up through
the ancestors of the

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,050
button to find the closest
confirmation class, then we're

36
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,380
going to search back down
through the children to find

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,300
elements with the
ticket class.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,810
To show this ul, we're going to
use the slide down method.

39
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,110
.slideDown() would show it,
.slideUp() would hide it, and

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,350
then .slideToggle() well, is
going to toggle between the

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,690
two states.

42
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,050
So let's do .slideDown()
like so.

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,260
So let's go ahead and try this
in our browser, but it doesn't

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,090
seem to be working.

45
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,910
We're going to have to figure
out how to debug this

46
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,920
JavaScript.

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,730
And one of the most basic ways
we can start debugging is with

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,560
the alert function.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
You're probably familiar
with this.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,720
You call alert in JavaScript.

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,000
And you get this
little pop up.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,830
This is JavaScript, not
necessarily jQuery.

53
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,250
And then another useful thing to
know about debugging is if

54
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,200
we fetch a DOM element using
jQuery, and call .length on

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,650
it, it will give us how many
nodes are on that page.

56
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,790
So if there was three list
items, it would return three.

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,670
We can combine these two to see
if there's any buttons on

58
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,360
the page when this
alert gets run.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,100
So we fetch the buttons
and call .length.

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,960
Oh, what we found here
is that it's zero.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
So it's not finding
any buttons.

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,800
That's probably because we're
not wrapping this code in a

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,440
DOM ready function.

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,700
So let's go ahead and do that.

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,410
Now we're using

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,800
(document).ready() just like so.

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,690
And now when we load our page,
ah, our alert pops up one.

68
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,950
So it did find the button.

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,440
So let's go ahead and jump back
into our web page, and

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
yep, when we click Flight
Details, it

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,905
properly slides down.

72
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,600
Time for you to jump into the
challenges, and I'll see you

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,850
in the next section.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,962
