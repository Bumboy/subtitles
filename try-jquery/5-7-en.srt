1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,940
So we've taken a look at styles,
but jQuery also gives

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,600
us the ability to do
some animations.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,270
How might we use some animations
on this page?

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,940
Well, maybe what we should
do is make each of those

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,380
vacations jump up a little
bit when we select them.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,960
Let's figure out
how to do that.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,700
So here we are back in our code,
and maybe what we should

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,030
do is have the LI that was
clicked move up 10 pixels,

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,760
negative 10 just like that.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,770
jQuery actually has a method
called animate that we can

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,420
send in CSS styles, and it will
slowly animate from its

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,260
current state to the style
that we give it.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,520
So in this case, we would write
animate top negative 10

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,470
pixels, and it will animate from
0 pixels to negative 10.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,720
Let's put that in our code.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,710
Now, let's see what
that looks like.

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,390
So we click on it, and each
of these items goes up.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,820
And well, it doesn't
go back down.

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,540
They just go up.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,890
So obviously, we're going
to have to deal

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,350
with that in a minute.

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,790
When this event handler is
called, we only want to make

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,790
it animate up if we just added
the highlighted class.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,890
However, if we just remove the
highlighted class when we

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,370
toggled, we want it to animate
back down to zero.

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,530
So we have an if statement
here, if vacation class

27
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,230
highlighted, then animate
up, else animate the

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,400
vacation back down.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,800
So let's go ahead and move
that up into our code.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,730
And have the second animate
line there, where we're

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,740
animating it back down to zero,
but we still need to

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,520
figure out what goes inside
of our if statement.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,630
We've got just some
pseudo code there.

34
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,380
Well, jQuery gives us a method
called hasClass.

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,460
We can check to see if a node
has a specific class.

36
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,140
So in this case, we'll call
this dot has class

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,860
highlighted, and if it
returns true, we know

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,400
that it has the class.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,539
So let's move that back up
into the if statement.

40
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,900
And now, if it has the class,
it's going to animate that up,

41
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,720
and if it doesn't, it's going
to animate LI back down.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,890
So here we go in our browser.

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,670
We click it once,
it goes back up.

44
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,450
We click it again, and
it goes back down.

45
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,170
Now, this is a little
bit slow.

46
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,370
We might want to speed up or
slow down the animation in

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,220
certain circumstance.

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,070
How might we do that?

49
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,760
Well, we can specify the speed
by adding a second argument.

50
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,860
In this case, if we did comma
400, that means it's going to

51
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,140
animate in 400 milliseconds,
and this is

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,910
actually the default.

53
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,220
So if we don't specify a
speed, by default, the

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,260
animation is going to take
400 milliseconds.

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,550
We could send in the argument
of fast, which would be the

56
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,040
same thing as specifying
200 milliseconds.

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,870
We can also specify the argument
slow, which, in this

58
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,620
case, would be 600
milliseconds.

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,280
And we can also use that speed
argument in other methods,

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,920
like slideToggle, fadeToggle,
slideDown, slideUp.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,170
They all work.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,410
So let's speed up
our animation.

63
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,900
This time making it fast,
just like you see here.

64
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,900
Now, when we go back into our
browser, we can see the

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,660
animation is definitely
a little more snappy.

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,860
Now, once again, we have CSS
inside of our JavaScript, and

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,670
again, it might give you that
not so fresh feeling.

68
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,380
So how might we get this
out of the JavaScript?

69
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,970
It turns out we can do this
animation in CSS by specifying

70
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,750
a transition like
you see here.

71
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,020
So we're specifying here that if
the top element is changed,

72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,860
it should transition
in 0.2 seconds.

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,590
Then, when we add the
highlighted class, we're

74
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,250
specifying the top is negative
10 pixels, which will cause

75
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,250
the animation to happen.

76
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,410
You've got to be careful when
using this however, because

77
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,160
it's only going to work with
browsers that support CSS

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,750
transitions.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,340
One way we can support
additional browsers is by

80
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,550
specifying the browser prefixes
as you see here.

81
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,810
So this is something you have to
be aware of if you want to

82
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,090
use these types of CSS
animations, and there's lots

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,970
of information out there on the
internet that will tell

84
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,670
you which ones you can use,
which ones are dangerous, and

85
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,915
there might be a code school
course or two on the subject.

86
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,070
So here we are, back in our
browser, and as you can see,

87
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,290
we can click, and we
still get that same

88
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,240
nice animation effect.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,970
All right, you've reached the
end of the videos, and now

90
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,880
it's time for you to get
into the challenges.
