1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,350
In this section, we're going
to look at some more events

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,380
that we can listen for
on our webpages.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,190
So here, inside of our webpage,
we want to make it so

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,230
that when we hover over that
little price tag that it also

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,329
displays the flight details.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,470
So how would we do that?

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,460
Well, you've already seen most
of the code that we need to

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,230
make this happen, namely
grabbing a DOM element, using

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,080
the on method, passing in the
h3, because we would want to

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,220
listen for events on h3.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,690
And then we just need to slide
down the ticket confirmation.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,390
Some of the mouse events
you can listen to.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,910
Click, you're obviously
familiar with.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,660
But there's a bunch
you can use.

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,110
In this case, we want to use
mouseenter, which fires when

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,465
the mouse is first positioned
over the element.

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,830
So let's move mouseenter up
into the code, just like so.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,870
This is going to show the ticket
when it's positioned

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,040
over that h3.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,320
So let's take a look
on the webpage.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,790
And you'll notice, when we hover
over that ticket icon,

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,310
it shows the details.

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,150
And still, if we click on the
Flight Details button, that'll

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,182
also show the ticket
confirmation.

25
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:12,600
This code that we've written has
some duplication going on.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,140
And we don't like duplication.

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,260
So how would we get rid of it?

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,150
Well, we could move the contents
of each of those

29
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,740
Event Handlers into its own
function called Show Ticket,

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,840
just like so.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,270
Then we'll move that up to the
top and change our Event

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,790
Handlers so that the third
argument is simply that

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,820
function that we just defined.

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,940
You'll notice here that even
though we're passing in a

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,080
function, we don't put
parentheses at

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,970
the end of the name.

37
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,080
If we did, it would call the
function immediately.

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,475
And we want it to call only when
the event is triggered.

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,770
And so now back on our webpage,
we can see that both

40
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,050
of these events still fire
properly and call that same

41
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,410
function, which we defined.

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,000
Time for you to try this
in the challenges.
