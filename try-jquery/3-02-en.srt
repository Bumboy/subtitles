jQuery will help you
build your dot-com.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,550
Find an element inside
of the DOM.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,000
Ajax traversal manipulation.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,750
Event handling and animation.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,370
Providing you with
versatility.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,805
An API with extensibility.

8
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:25,130
jQuery is something
you can't ignore.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,023
Write less.

10
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,273
Do more.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,870
I'm Gregg Pollack, and you're
watching "Try jQuery." This is

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,070
level three, but we're going
to be talking about working

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,340
with the DOM. Let's take a look
at the web page that we're

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,730
going to be working with.

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,850
Here you can vacation
packages.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,000
In this case, a Hawaiian
vacation.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,130
And we have that button.

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,505
And when we press that button,
it changes to the price of

19
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:50,420
that Hawaiian Vacation.

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,130
In this case, $399.99.

21
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,135
Let's figure out how to
write the jQuery to

22
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,690
make that button work.

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,370
So here is the DOM of our web
page, as you can see.

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,750
We need to do two things.

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,980
First, we need to append
a new DOM node to the

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,820
bottom with the price.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,260
And then secondly, we need to
remove the button altogether.

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,735
So how might we do this
using jQuery?

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,320
You might notice, here we're
inside of our application.js,

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
where we're going to write
all of our jQuery code.

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,150
And the first thing we start out
with is our document.ready

32
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,840
function, as you see here.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,190
Inside of there, the first thing
we want to do is create

34
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,310
a new paragraph with
the price.

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,530
So well, one way we could do
this using JavaScript is we

36
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,780
could var price = "from
$399.00", which is the text.

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,120
However, we want to create HTML
here, so you might think

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,900
that we would just do
From $399 and wrap

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
that inside of a paragraph.

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,270
But that still wouldn't
be right.

41
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,270
In this case, we want to create
a new DOM node by

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,110
sending the HTML into
the jQuery function.

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,080
This will create a DOM
node and set it equal

44
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,510
to the price variable.

45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,300
However, it does not add this
new node onto the DOM.

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,210
It's not attached
anywhere yet.

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,460
That's going to be
our next step.

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,510
Now let's move that price
variable into our

49
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,580
application.js, and there's a
couple different ways that we

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,310
can add that node
into our DOM.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,740
We could use the append method,
the prepend method,

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,480
the after method, or
the before method.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,520
And we're going to go into
more detail what each

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,280
of these would do.

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,450
First, we need to select a node
out of our DOM, which

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,230
will serve as a reference point
to put our price node,

57
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,140
in this case, before.

58
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,340
So we're grabbing the vacation
class element.

59
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,100
And then before the vacation
class, we're adding the price

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,010
node. This is where I would add
the paragraph, which in this

61
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,200
case, is not what we're
looking for.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,820
So let's try a different
method.

63
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,750
What if we tried adding the
price after the vacation node?

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,910
In this case, it would be put
it down here at the bottom,

65
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,640
which is also not what
we're looking for.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,150
We could try using the
prepend method.

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,030
In this case, the price node
would be added as the first

68
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,280
child of the LI with
class vacation.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,060
That still is not quite right.

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,430
In this case, I think what we're
looking for is append.

71
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,770
Append is going to add that
price node as the last child

72
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,810
of our list item.

73
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,220
OK.

74
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,010
So we're appending the price
in the right location.

75
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,040
The only step left is
to remove the button

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
node from the DOM.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,530
To do this, we simply
fetch the node and

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,710
call the remove method.

79
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,150
That will remove it
from the DOM.

80
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,370
So now with that code, when we
load up the page, the DOM is

81
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,020
going to load.

82
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,180
And as soon as it's loaded,
it's going to add that

83
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,130
paragraph and hide the button.

84
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,160
So we're going to see the price
like you see there.

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,870
Now obviously, this
isn't complete.

86
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,860
We want to make it so that when
we click the button, it

87
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,520
changes, which we'll get into
in the next section.

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,190
And before we get there, there's
four other methods you

89
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,790
should know about.

90
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,560
There's the appendTo, prependTo,
insertAfter, and

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,680
insertBefore.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,360
These methods are different
because of the

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,029
order of the syntax.

94
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,089
So in this case, if I wanted to
do the same thing we were

95
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,860
doing before with append,
I would write

96
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,440
price.appendTo vacation.

97
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,610
So the reference point
comes at the end.

98
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,910
Some people think this
is more readable.

99
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,120
I'll leave it up to you.

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,890
You can do it anyway you want.

101
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,100
And now it's time for you to
get into the challenges.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,279
